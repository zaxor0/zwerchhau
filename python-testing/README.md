# Dice Results
## Best of 2 or best of 3
This was to help test what would be the most rounded character creation method. It looks like best of 2 is the optimal choice.
|Result| best of 3 | best of 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6   | 409 | 303 |
| 5   | 307 | 262 |
| 4   | 177 | 200 |
| 3   | 73  | 140 |
| 2   | 32  | 77  |
| 1   | 1   | 17  |

After some script improvements, here are some runs of 10k rolls:
