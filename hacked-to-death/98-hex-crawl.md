# Hex Crawl Procedures
Inspired by Dolmenwood

## Travel
- A Point system is the easiest way to keep track of movement through hexes.
- A party has 6 movement points per day; to be spent on travel or searching.
- Searching a Hex uses 3 points and uncovers all hidden features.
- Searching a Hex requires nearly the whole party, 1 character is allowed to hunt or forage instead.
- Sundown occurs once the party uses 6 points, assuming they start at dawn.
- For every point over 6, the party loses 2 hours of time & takes -1 on camping.
- With horses, travel is easier; depending on the terrain you may be walking along side them.

| Terrain         | On Foot | On Horseback |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| Roads & Trails  |    2    |       1      |
| Plains & Coasts |    2    |       2      |
| Forests & Hills |    3    |       2      |
| Mountains       |    5    |       4      |
| Swamps          |    6    |       6      |

## Horses
- You ease the burden of travel, and have improved sleep.
- A horse may either carry:
  - One person, their gear, and an additional 250 pounds of gear
  - Two People, one person's set of gear
- Feed for a single horse requires 1g per 5 days of travel. 

## Weather
- Poor weather will reduce the party's travel points per day.
- Wet and snowy weather effects camping negatively.

| Weather       | Travel     | Camping    | Firewood  |
|---------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Clear         | No Effect  | No Effect  | No Effect |
| Hot and Humid | -1 Point   | No Effect  | No Effect |
| Rainy         | -1 Point   | -1 Point   | -1 Point  |
| Heavy Rain    | -2 Points  | -2 Points  | -2 Points |
| Snowing       | -1 Point   | -3 Points  | No Effect |
| Heavy Snow    | -2 Points  | -3 Points  | -1 Point  |

## Camping
- A good camp and nights rest will recover hit points
- Total the points based on the below table, gain that HP overnight
- **Campfire** requires dry firewood
- **Firewood** can be gathered with firewood points, effected by terrain and weather

## Firewood
- You need 8 firewood points to have wood for overnight
- A fire overnight improves sleep & reduces chances for random encounters
- For each character that searches for firewood, gain 2d4 firewood points

| Heavy Rain         | -2 Points       | 

## Hunting and Gathering

- Hunting returns 3d4 rations.
- Gathering has two options, one whle while traveling, and the other focused.
- Gathering while traveling yields 1d4 rations worth of food.
- Focused gathering, like hunting, uses 3 travel points, but returns 4d4 rations.
