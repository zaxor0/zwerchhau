# Hex Crawl Procedures

## Travel
- A Point system is the easiest way to keep track of movement through hexes.
- A party has 6 movement points per day; to be spent on travel or searching.
- Searching a Hex uses 3 points and uncovers all hidden features. It requires nearly the whole party; 1 character is allowed to hunt or forage instead.
- Sundown occurs once the party uses 6 points, assuming they start at dawn.
- For every point over 6, the party loses 2 hours of time & takes -1 on camping.
- On horseback may mean riding or walking along them, per the terrain.

| Terrain         | On Foot | On Horseback |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| Roads & Trails  |    2    |       1      |
| Plains & Coasts |    2    |       2      |
| Forests & Hills |    3    |       2      |
| Mountains       |    5    |       4      |
| Swamps          |    6    |       6      |

## Horseback Travel
- On Horseback travel bonuses require the entire party to have horses.
- Feed for a single horse costs 1g per 5 days of travel. 
- A horse may carry one person & their personal gear, plus 250 lbs. of items.
- Optionally, a horse may carry two people and their personal gear.

## Weather
- Poor weather will reduce the party's travel points per day.
- Wet and snowy weather effects camping negatively.
