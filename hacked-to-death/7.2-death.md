## Zero Hit Points
- Death occurs when brought below 0 HP.
- If you are at 0, you are considering dying.
- Dying characters must be **stabilized** within **3 combat rounds** to avoid death.
- **Stabilization** requires either magical healing or a successful insight check by another character.
- If a character attempts to stabalize a dying character, they may not perform any other actions this round.
