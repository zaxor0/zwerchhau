# Maxims

These are the ideas around which the game is to be played.

1. You are not your character, your skill ought not be limited by your character's attributes.
2. Your character has their own understanding of lore, history, and myth; your DM shall reveals these as your character would understand them.
3. Time is precious and combat is brutal
4. Worry not about balance, seek interesting solutions to difficult problems
