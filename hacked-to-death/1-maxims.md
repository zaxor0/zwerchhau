# HACKED TO DEATH

It breaks their backs

It breaks their bones

It breaks the binds of unearthed tomes


# Maxims for Players

These are the ideas around which the game is to be played.

1. You are not your character, your skill ought not be limited by your character's attributes.
2. Your character has their own understanding of lore, history, and myth; your DM shall reveals these as your character would understand them.
3. Time is precious and combat is brutal
4. Worry not about balance, seek interesting solutions to difficult problems

# Maxims for DMs
- **Embrace the chaos** when random chance is contrary to your expectations. 
- **Embrace the law** and order of your world. Let the larger powers make their influence known, and their long term plans play out.
