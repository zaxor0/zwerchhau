NEW NAME - HACKED TO DEATH
to be named Death? into the odd and black hack, hacked for bx
main point, hirelings matter

four stats, dex str wil, and cha

- 3d6 dtl
- char copy 0e hirelings & loyalty base
    classes with defining characteristics
- 6 at level 1, roll 1d6 for other levels
- warriors get attacks per 0e
- wizards get 0e powerful spells
- need to improve rogues
    attack roll determines damage, 10+

combat hacks:

- shields may be splintered
- critical hit tables (combat only)
- critical fumbles
- relics of violence, 17+ hits to players cause these scars and etc

1 crit fumble
2 - 9 miss
10, 11 1dmg per die --- glancing blow!
12-15 norm
16-19 size up
20+ double norm dice

no advantage, explicitly none, not allowed, too good.

hirelings and mercs tables

- unique characteristics
- paths for evolving
- chances for greater loyalty, chances to backstab
    - chaos scales with more hirelings
- maybe in combat, to simplify, they have to act in coordination, as a squad
    - every 3 hirelines works together, but if you have 4 then 1 can do whatever
    - each hireling in a squad raises up the damage die, starting at d6. so 3 hirelings is a d12 attack roll
- outside of combat they can each do things as ordered
- your cha maxes out how many hirelings you can get, but you can always have one low grade hireling that levels up

strongholds

per caster
one page of spells, one page page of deviations, abominations, and deviltry
use 0e spells when possible

versatile 2h weapons are 1d8
true 2h are 1d10, they are slow, roll after other weapons


## Combat against Monsters
- If player characters outnumber a non-humanoid monster, they may attack its appendages.
- Monsters are not humanoid and often fight with "natural" weapons.
- You may optionally attack a monsters means of attack, such as a bear's claw
- Using the monsters HD stat, if players target say the "bear's claw" and make *that many* successful attacks, it drops its damage die by 1 size.
