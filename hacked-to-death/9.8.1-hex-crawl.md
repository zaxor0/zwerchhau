## Hunting and Gathering
- Hunting or gathering can be done by 1 or more character.
- Expend points for hunting or gathering on a *per hex basis*.
- Hunting or gathering always yields results, for each character doing so.
- If the party is searching the hex, only 1 character may hunt or gather.
- Hunting requires a ranged weapon.
- For example, if in a new hex, two characters may gather at the same time. This expends 1 travel point but yields 2d4 rations.

| Activity  | Travel Points | Rations Gained |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Hunting   |       3       |  1d6 + 2       |
| Gathering |       1       |  1d4           |

## Search the Hex
- When in a hex, the party may spend 3 travel points to search it.
- Searching reveals all hidden features of the hex.
- When searching, one party member may instead hunt or gather.

## The Lost Check
- Not applicable if on a road or trail.
- Roll 1d6, if you roll a 1, you are lost.
- If you are lost, roll 1d6 on table below, note the effect.

| Roll  | Reason    | Effect            |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
|   1   | Equipment | -1 Travel Point   |
|   2   | Weather   | -1 Travel Point   |
| 3 - 5 | Terrain   | -2 Travel Points  |
|   6   | Encounter | Roll an Encounter |
