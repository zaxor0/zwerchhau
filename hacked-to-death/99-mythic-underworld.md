# Designing the Mythic Underworld
- The mythic underworld is the dungeon ecosystem that exists beneath civilizations existing, ancient, or dead.
- There are many entrances to the mythic underworld, the following is a guide to building out a dungeon.
- Don't design every level at once, just the first level or two. 

## Location & Entrance
Roll a d12 three times or choose what type of entrance this location will have.

| Roll | Location   | Appearance       | Structure       |
|------|------------|------------------|-----------------|
|   1  | Forest     | Weathered        | Keep or Tower   | 
|   2  | Cavern     | Overgrown        | Castle          | 
|   3  | Grove      | Disheveled       | Standing Stones |

|  12  | Swamp      | Erupted Upward   | Prison          | 

## Layout and Rooms
The goal here is to develop a diagram of the dungeon, you can develop the floorplan later.

1. First, roll 1d6 to determine the number of overlays, these will be paths and corridoors.
2. Second, for each overlay roll 1d6 to determine its shape.
3. On a scratch paper, draw each of these shapes overlapping one another.
4. Next, roll 1d6 to determine the dice pool for rooms, then roll that pool and count the total.
5. Using this total, sketch out room locations, make them connect to or sit ontop the overlays.
6. Freely add any corridors to connect the rooms.

| Roll | Overlay Count | Shapes    | Room Count | Factions |
|------|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|
|   1  |       1       | Square    |  2d4       |     0    |
|   2  |       1       | Rectangle |  1d6 + 1   |     1    |
|   3  |       2       | Triangle  |  2d6       |     2    |
|   4  |       2       | Rhombus   |  2d6 + 2   |     2    |
|   5  |       3       | Trapezoid |  3d6       |     3    |
|   6  |       3       | Circle    |  3d6 + 3   |     4    |
