# Ability Checks
- Roll 1d20 against a specific ability score, success is equal to or under. 
- Bonuses may be added to your "target number," giving the player a higher number to roll equal to or under.
- Only required for difficult tasks or risky tasks. 
- **Risky**: If a task is mundane, but danger is imminent and a failure would be terrible, make a check.
- **Difficult**: If a task requires specialized knowledge or skill, and there is less time than ideal to perform it, make a check.
- If plenty of time is available and the player has the required background, a check is probably not required.
- If characters can reasonably work together, such as moving a large stone, make 1 check with a bonus.
- Bonuses should range from +1, a minor bonus, to +4 for a major bonus.

# Saving Throws

- Saving throws are rolled against your ability score or your spell save, DM discretion.
- A success is when you roll 1d20 equal or under the appropriate score.
- Knowledge checks should be given bonus based on character race and backgrounds.
- Spell saves are tied to your class and increase with experience.
- What you roll is determined by your DM.
