# Hex Crawl Procedures

## Travel Procedure
1. Start with 6 travel points
2. Roll for weather, reduce points for rain, snow, or high heat.
3. If hunting or gathering expend points. 
4. Begin Travel, spend points for each new hex.
5. **Optional**, search a hex, spend 3 points.
6. Once you have spent 6 points, sundown occurs.
7. You may continue at a cost of -1 point and 2 hours of time.

## Travel Points
- A Point system is the easiest way to keep track of movement through hexes.
- A party has 6 movement points per day; to be spent on travel or searching.
- You expend travel points immediately when entering a new hex.
- Searching a Hex uses 3 points and uncovers all hidden features. It requires nearly the whole party; 1 character is allowed to hunt or forage instead.
- Sundown occurs once the party uses 6 points, assuming they start at dawn.
- For every point over 6, the party loses 2 hours of time & takes -1 on camping.
- On horseback may mean riding or walking along them, per the terrain.
