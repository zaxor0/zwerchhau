# Designing the Mythic Underworld
- The mythic underworld is the dungeon ecosystem that exists beneath civilizations existing, ancient, or dead.
- There are many entrances to the mythic underworld, this following is a guide to building out a dungeon.
- Don't design every level at once, just the first level or two. 

## Entrances
Roll or choose what type of entrance this location will have

| Roll | Appearance       |  Entrance              | 
|------|------------------|------------------------|
|   1  | Weathered        | Mason Stone Structure  |   Double Doors, Wooden  | 
|   2  | Overgrown        | Natural Cavern         |   Double Doors, Metal   | 
|   3  | Disheveled       | Standing Stones        |   Iron Gate             |

|  10  | Built Over       |
|  11  | Outcropping      |
|  12  | Erupted Upward   |

## Layout and Rooms
- For each level beneath the surface follow these tables
1. First, roll 1d6 to determine the number of overlays, these will be paths and corridoors.
2. Second, for each overal roll 1d6 to determine its shape.
3. On a scratch paper, draw each of these shapes overlapping one another.
4. Next, roll 1d6 to determine the dice pool for rooms, then roll that pool and count the total.
5. Using this total, sketch out room locations, make them connect to the overlays

| Roll | Overlay Count | Shapes    | Room Count | Factions |
|------|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|
|   1  |       1       | Square    |  2d4       |     0    |
|   2  |       1       | Rectangle |  1d6 + 1   |     1    |
|   3  |       2       | Triangle  |  2d6       |     2    |
|   4  |       2       | Rhombus   |  2d6 + 2   |     2    |
|   5  |       3       | Trapezoid |  3d6       |     3    |
|   6  |       3       | Circle    |  3d6 + 3   |     4    |
