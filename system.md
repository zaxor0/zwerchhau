- Classes and Spells inspired by D&D
- Magical effects inspired by Dungeon Crawl Classics
- Combat, Magic, Skills inspired by conversations with Gronka

## Serve the game
DMs and players both have have a duty to serve the game, to make the overall experience of this game enjoyable. What enjoyable is, exactly, is not easy to define; however, there are a few items to consider:

- Set expectations; what is the world like, what are the people like?
  - Some worlds are dangerous, some people are distrustful, some places are scary; a DM has a duty to their players to give them sign posts about these details.
- Accept failures; trails, tribulations, can help gameplay as long as they give players opportunities to continue to develop their characters.
  - Consider the [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey)

## Dice and Checks

The bulk of this system will use D6s for checks and spells; damage will be done with other dice depending on weapons used.

| Roll | Result        | Example opening a locked door                                        |
|------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Major Failure | your lock pick breaks, as does the lock                              |
| 2    | Minor Failure | your lock pick is damaged somewhat                                   |
| 3    | Mixed Results | the lock is damaged but the door will open                           |
| 4    | Mixed Results | the door is unlocked, but cannot be opened quietly                   |
| 5    | Minor Success | the door is unlocked and opens quietly & with ease                   |
| 6    | Major Success | the door is unlocked and you are now more adept at this kind of lock |

A 3 should skew to slightly less good results and 4 should skew to slightly better results, at the DM's discretion.

### Check Maniputalors
There are three items that can effect a check, they take precedent in the follow order:
1. Skills, as defined by the player's class: give advantage on specific skill checks
2. Natural Traits, as defined by the player's identity: give +2 to general skill based checks, unless otherwise noted
3. Relevant and high ability scores reduce the likelihood of a major failure

Players only ever get one of these maniplations for a given check, they do not stack. Players must take use the one of higher precedent if able.

#### 1. Skills and Advantage
If your character is skilled in the specific task at hand, you will roll with advantage. Advantage means roll 2d6 and pick the better of the two.

#### 2. Natural Traits
Some natural traits would apply to a set of skills, and would therefore give a +2 bonus to any check related to this trait. However, some traits would be very specific, such as infravision and would not normally effect a die roll.

#### 3. Relevant Ability Scores
If you have a relevant ability score of a 5 or 6, a roll of 1 is not necessarily a major failure. You will need to roll a **failure check** to "confrim the failure" which occurs on a 1 or 2.

- 1's become minor failures, with a check for major failure. 
  - Roll a 1d6 for a **Failure Check** where a 1 to 3 results in a major failure.
- 2's becomes mixed results, but not entirely in your favor

Examples of relevant abilities for tasks are:

- Dexterity for a climb check
- Strength for a lift check
- Intelligence for a research check

The relevance of an ability is determined by the DM, who should give this information to the player prior to a roll. For instance, if the player is strong and wants to lift 200 Lbs. then they have a relevant ability score; however, if this same player tries to lift 1000 Lbs. then they do not have a relevant ability bonus.

### Defining Success
When there are difficult checks to be made, and the ideal results may be beyond the bounds of a characters a skill, a DM should give the players an idea what a "success" would generally look like.

Building tension is an excellent tool for engaging gameplay, but its important to temper player expectations on exceptionally difficult tasks. 

Since some tasks would simply be outside the ability of a player, a "success" may just be the best case scenario given their abilities. 

As an example, if a player has a high strength and wants to "kick down an iron door," but would not be physically capable due to the iron reinforcements, the DM should inform the player that "at best the player will damage the door, but they could not alone break it down."

We do not necessarily need to give players negative modifiers to prevent them from performing a ridiculous task (solving a quantum equation in minutes), but *we do need* to give them an idea of what they are capable of in the *best possible case*.

As a last note and recommendation, while a DM should give the idea of possible successes, this should be around a 5 in terms of the die roll as a 6 might give unique or interesting bonuses that themselves should be a surpise.

# Character Creation
1. First roll your ability scores
2. Choose your race, heritage, or background
   - Pick two natural traits
3. Choose your class
   - Pick skills based on your intelligence, 1/2 rounded up 
   - Pick skills based on your class

## Abilities
Like traditional D&D, players should roll their ability scores. It is recommended to roll "down the line‚Äù where each rolls is not arranged according to preference. 

For each of the 4 abilities, *roll 2d6* and keep the best number.

- Strength
- Dexterity
- Will
- Intelligence
- Charisma

### Constitution 
Constituion is total sum of Strength, Dexterity, Will, and your current level. Used in combat, it represents your total ability to persevere and survive. The majority of damage in combat is against your constitution, not your flesh and blood. This means that you risk being exhausted and overwhelmed when you take constitution damage.

If your constitution reaches 0, you do not die. However, you collapse and are not reliably able to defend yourself against attacks.

### Intelligence
This represents your ability to learn and both informal and formal education. Half this number and round up, this represents additional skills you receive advantage on. You may also choose to use one of these points on additional languages, instead of skills.

### Charisma
Charisma rolls are to be rarely used in this system; ideally they are reserved for critical moments or where serious harm could occur. However, these checks should be accompanied by role playing.

As a role playing game, dialogue is considered a core feature; as such, reducing social interactions to points or rolls limits experience of play in regards to this "core" feature. 

Examples of good charisma checks:
- A fighter needs to rally her mercenary allies 
- A rogue needs to con their way out of a likely torture or death

Examples of bad charisma checks:
- A bard wants to seduce a maiden
- A wizard wants to convince a duke to betray his lover

Not all players prefer to role play as their character, but in dialogue based interactions players should come up with details on how or what they do while interacting with NPCs. Simple saying "I want to convince the king to hire us" provides less flavor for everyone else at the table than saying "My character, points out his noble lineage of the House of Swarsington, provides examples of loyalty to the throne (including a list of battles), in order to sway the king to hire us."

This system assumes that a player's character should be however charismatic they want them to be. That does not mean they can charm their way into anything, but any attempt to do so better serves gameplay with thoughtful and engaging dialogue. 

What is a successful charismatic action then? This ultimately should be up to the DM, who should have some concept of what a given NPC might find convincing or not. 

If a check is needed, simply roll "behind the scenes." If a player has relevant skills, diplomacy, lying, or is knowledgeable on the topic at hand, consider giving them advantage.  

### Wisdom
All players start with 1 wisdom.

Wisdom is earned through gameplay, the DM should keep track of:

- Moment where players succeed in an impressive fashion
- Moments where players fail but learn something important about the world or game.

Each of these would grant players involved a point of wisdom.

Wisdom is a resource that can be spent...

### Hit points and Death
All player characters have 6 hit points, this does not increase with leveling. Often the rules refer to damage to flesh, this is damage to your hit points--as opposed to damage to your constitution. 

If a player character has less than zero hit points, they are dead; this is the case whether or not they have any CON points left.

## Race, Background, or Heritage 
The Dungeon Master has the last say in allowed races, heritage, or background. But players need not refer to their character's identity as a race if it doesn't suit their vision. 

Some backgrounds could be unbalanced\*, the following table is just a suggestion.

| Classic  | Expanded   | Modern\*    |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Human    | Half Orc   | Half Giant  |
| Elf      | Half Elf   | Dragonborn  |
| Dwarf    | Gnome      | Tiefling    |
| Halfling |            | Fairy       |

It is advisable to have limits on player physical size and capacity for flight and speed. In the unlikely event of a game breaking mechanic a DM reservers the right to reduce the power of a unique ability created by a player.  

### Pick Two Traits
Traits in this rule set are considered to be a _broad characteristic_, unlike skills which would apply to specific tasks. They should have a borad influence on skill based tasks or represent a single natural ability that itself is not overpowered for gameplay.
For whatever background a player picks, they should decide 2 traits that describe them (and their people generally) that would effect gameplay.
Examples:

- Dwarf : underground awareness, magic resistant
- Elf : magic adept, poison resistant
- Human : skillful, adaptable
- Halfling : stealthy, infravision

Player example: "My character is a tall burly human from the desert region, my people are known for being (1) skillful  and (2) stealthy"

Natural traits allow for a +2 on a roll relevant to the skill. For example, if a player chooses halfling and his heritage is of a stealthy people he would rol +2 on a sneak check, hide check, or any other stealthy skill.

However, skills which are specific and trained take precedence; if a player is trained in sneaking but they are also stealthy, the roll advantage on sneak based checks instead of the +2 from being stealthy. They do not get both. 

Some natural traits are more focused like magic adept; this could mean that a player starts with an additional spell if they are a wizard, or maybe they receive a bonus when studying for new spells.

The details of natural traits should be worked out with the DM. A list of recommended traits and their description will be provided in the appendix.

#### Example Traits 
| Trait                 | Description                                   	                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stout or Tough        | +2 Consitution                                            	         |
| Magical resistance    | +1 spell on spell saves              		                         | 
| Poison resistance     | +1 on poison saves            	  	           	         |
| Toxic resistance      | +1 on toxic saves 		                 	                 |
| Sleep resistance      | +1 on sleep saves 		                 	                 |
| Charm resistance      | +1 on charm saves 		                 	                 |
| Educated Society      | 2 additional knowledge inspired skills                                 |
| Dark vision           | Can see black and white in the dark up to 60 feet     	         |
| Languages of enemies  | Can speak two languages of common monster foes             	         |
| Common Enemy          | Gain +1 to attack (melee or range) vs. 1 monster type       	         |
| Giant Defense         | 2 Giant or large type monster take -1 on attack rolls vs you	         |
| Hide in plainsight    | Not in metal armor, alone or in a group with this trait, +2 to hide    |
| Underground awareness | +2 to determine approximate depth and various underground architecture |

## Skills
Skills are specific abilities that a given player would have, they are more focused than traits and represent your personal experience and training. Except for DM discretion, there are generally no limits to what a skill could be. 

A DM has the right to reject a skill for being too broad. An example of a badly chosen skill would be a character who is good at "building;" structures are build out of a variety of material and techniques, a more appropriate choice would be carpentry or masonry.

All characters have a number of skills based on their intelligence, (Int / 2, rounded up); additionally some classes provide more skills, as does leveling in a class.

Besides during combat, most things *should not* require a skill check. Climbing up an old stonewall, negotiating prices in a market, dressing a wound, are not the sort of things that you would need to have a skill check in. It is recommended to limit skill checks since combat in this system is quite nuanced.

Skill checks are required when specialized experience or knowledge is required; specifically if failure of the task would lead to terrible consequences. Such as pick pocketing the kings purse, or forging a nobles signature, organizing the constuction of fortified defenses.

Even then, with specialized skills being required, group efforts to resolve a problem with coherent dialog between players should generally trump a skill check. As long as the plan is detailed, concievable, and somewhat reasonable, players should be able to execute complex tasks without pedantic skill checks.

### Combat Skills
These skills are mentioned because they are specifically referenced in the combat rules and would be appropriate for any player interested in combat.

- Combat in heavy armor: Ignore unskilled CON damage in melee
- Grappling: +1 to engagement on grappling checks 
- Wrestling throws: +2 CON damage (instead of none)
- Disarming: Advantage on disarm checks
- Improvised weaponry: +1 to damage roll
- Defensive melee combat: -1 to opponent's damage rolls 
- Firing into Melee: +1 to combat roll (negates the -1)

### Sample Non-Combat Skills
|Samples| | |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Carpentry   | Sailing          | Library Research       |
| Bartering   | Lock Picking     | Specialized Knowledge  |
| Fletching   | Forgery          | Diplomacy              |
| Smithing    | Mountaineering   |                        |
| Tanning     | Construction     |                        |

## Classes
There are 4 classes based on classic D&D archtypes. While players may pick anything as a subclass as the focal identity of their character, they should try to stay within one of the classes. Classes guide leveling and character advancement.

- Warriors : Someone with advanced combat training
- Rogues : Someone with keen skills or intuition: slyness, discreteness, cleverness, back stabbing
- Magic-Users : Someone with spellcasting abilities, gained from study, natural adeptness to magic, or supernatural influence
- Priests : Someone with spellcasting-like abilities that are inspired by a holy deity or supernatural presence (personified or not)

Players should pick a subclass or identity that falls under one of these types. This is completely open ended, players are free to come up with any kind of identity. Here are some examples:

- Warrior : Streetfighter, Kung Fu Master, Gladiator, Paladin, Ranger, Knight, Swordsman, Samurai, Crossbowmen, Archer
- Rogues : Thief, Bard, Assassin, Scout, Swashbuckler, Detective
- Magic-Users : Mage, Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Witch, Necromancer, Illusionist, Sage
- Priest : Druid, Cleric, Monk, Preacher, Cultist

Players should develop a clear idea of what background, training, or expierence they have.

### Warriors
Warriors start with 1 weapon specialization, players may freely pick any weapon that suits their intended character identity.
This gives them the following abilities with their chosen weapon:

- For combat with their chosen weapon, they may riposte for full damage on a major success parry roll [6].
- For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, advantage roll for damage
- For bows, two ranged attacks per round ranged combat rules.

For every even level as a warrior (2,4,6,etc.) they may gain either:

- 1 additional weapon specialization, they gain the above abilities for this weapon.
- 1 combat weapon feat. This is like a skill but it pertains to just 1 weapon type. Players should be creative here and work with their DM. Examples include:
  - Swift attack, gain +1 attacks with weapon against a single target during combat (recommended limit of +2)
  - Heavy attack, deal +1 constitution damage
  - Lethal attack, deal +1 flesh/HP damage on 6's
  - Cleaving attack, upon delivering a killing blow to a standing target, additional "unused" damage may be applied to an adjacent target.

Starting at level 2, warriors may gain henchmen who are willing to adventure with the party for a portion of the treasure. They are additional fighters with melee weapon and follow tactical orders given by the player character. Their basic stats are, 6HP, 10 Con, and they only deal 1d6 damage.

#### Henchmen Progression
| Level |  Max Count | Loyalty |
|-------|------------|---------|
|   1   |      0     |    -    |
|   2   |      1     |    4    |
|   3   |      2     |    5    |
|   4   |      2     |    6    |
|   5   |      3     |    7    |
|   6   |      3     |    8    |
|   7   |      3     |    9    |
|   8   |      4     |    10   |
|   9   |      4     |    11   |
|   10  |      4     |    12   |
|   11  |      5     |    13   |
|   12  |      5     |    14   |
|   13  |      5     |    15   |
|   14  |      6     |    16   |

### Rogues
Rogues starts with 3 skill specializations, they may pick any **specific** skill or task to have an advantage on performing. This is more narrow than the background traits. Generally this should follow a rogue-ish motif, but with a good character concept a player should not feel limited. Examples include:

- Sneaking: players are talented at moving around in a hidden fashion and hiding in shadows
- Lock picking: players are exceptional at opening a variety of locks
- Sleight of hand: players are talented at being physically misleading and trickery
- Lying / verbal deception: players are exceptional at spinning falsehoods to unknowing victims
- Seduction: players exude charisma and physical attraction, NPCs have a disadvantage when trying to resist player suggestions

Backstab: 
- This is a special attacks only Rogues (but not Bards) may have.
- Only applicable to weapons the player character is specailized in.
- The weapon must be in hand, if the player is not hidden they must pass a sleight of hand check on a 5 ot 6. 
- The backstab: performs a successful attack, player rolls the damage that is fully applied to HP and not to CON.
- Starts combat round if the victim lives or if there are any additional combatants

Weapon Specialization:
- For combat with their chosen weapon, they may riposte for full damage on a major success parry roll [6].
- For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, advantage roll for damage
- For bows, two ranged attacks per round ranged combat rules.

For every even level as a rogue (2,4,6,etc.) they may gain one of:

- one additional skill, rogueish or relevant to their character's experience
- one additional advantage die for a given skill, limit of +2. For instance, sleight of hand +2 means roll 3 die pick the best roll.
- one additional weapon specialization, limit of 2 total.

#### Bards
A Bard starts with 2 skill specializations instead of 3, may never have more than 1 weapon specialization, and gains additional skills every 3rd level. 
- May never have back stab

|   13  |  3 3 3 3 1     |
|   14  |  3 3 3 3 2     |

### Magic-Users
Mages know 1 spell at level 1 and can cast up to 1 spell a day. Additionally, Mages gain 1 skill based on their subclass. This could be knowldged based, experience based, training based, etc. Some example include:

- Knowledge of local history
- speak an ancient language fluently
- skilled in diplomatic policies
- skilled in debate
- Strategic warfare
- Mercantile economics

|   13  |  4 4 4 3 3 3   |
|   14  |  4 4 4 4 3 3   |

### Priests
Priests are distinguished from magic-users becuase they *believe* (with or without good justification) that their magical abilities are both:

- attuned to a moral or natural order of the universe
- only possible due to a supernatural influence

The ability of a priest to case a healing spell, for example, is evidence to them that their moral / religious/ supernatural based beliefs are objectively correct. 

There are two types of priests, "holy warriors" who fight for their gods / beliefs and "holy ritualists" who channel divine powers and perform rituals.

#### Holy Warriors
- Do not gain spell abilities at level 1, they gain them at level 2 after proving their faith
- Never gain the ability to perform rituals
- Can turn the undead
- Have 1 weapon specialization
- Skilled in tending the wounded

#### Holy Ritualists
- Start with 1 spell known, 1 cast per day
- Can perform ritual versions of a spell over the course of 1 hour, without "casting" them.
- Can turn the undead
- Skilled in tending the wounded

\*Only a holy ritualist gains a spell at first level, not a holy warrior.

## Equipment

### Weapons

#### Melee
| Size        | Damage | Examples                                                    |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Small       | 1d4    | club, dagger, dart, improvised weapon                       |
| Medium      | 1d6    | short sword, rapier, quarter staff, handaxe, mace, 1h spear |
| Long, Heavy | 1d8    | 1h longsword, 1h battleaxe, greatclub, flail                |
| Two Handed  | 2d6    | 2h longsword, 2h battleaxe, 2h spear                        |
| Great       | 1d12   | greatsword, great axe, heavy polearms                       |

#### Great Weapons 
These are heavy, oversized, two handed weapons. Therefore, without proper training and strength, they are slower to use. To use one without penalty, you must:

- Have a specialization in with a specific great weapon
- have a 6 in strength

If you do not meet both of these requirements, then suffer a -1 on Dex related combat result checks.
Lastly, you may *not use dex* for slash related combat checks.

#### Ranged

| Size        | Damage | Examples                |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------|
| Small       | 1d4    | hand crossbow           |
| Medium      | 1d6    | crossbow, short bow     |
| Long, Heavy | 1d8    | longbow, heavy crossbow |

- Crossbows can only ever fire once per combat round
- With weapon specialization, bows may fire twice per round.

It is recommended to not allow longbows in standard combat; instead short bows should be used in most scenarios. This rules system has a prejudice against longbows, as historically they would from great distances in large scale battles and not the squad style combat seen in most table top RPGs. Ultimately, it is up to the discretion of the DM

### Armor

Armor reduces the damage of successful attacks that deal damage to HP only. However, in combat, any type damage cannot reduced to 0; meaning, at least 1 point of damage must be dealt to either flesh or constitution.

| Size   | Defense | Examples                    |
|--------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Light  |   -1    | leather, studded leather    |
| Medium |   -2    | chainmail, beastplate, hide |
| Heavy  |   -3    | platemail, scalemail        |

- Without a skill in "combat with heavy armor," combatants burn an additional 1 CON for each round of melee.

#### Shields
Whether a buckler, heater, or tower shield, all shields provide:
- +1 bonus to parry
- -1 Con Damage per turn of melee combat
