# Combat changes over versions
An overview of changes with each version of classic DND

# 0e Combat 

## Initiative and Order of actions
- Initiative determine which "side" acts first
  - initiative dice are rolled for each side, 1d6, highest goes first.
- Party with initiative performs the following steps:
  - Missile Fire (ranged attacks)
  - Casting Spells (those casting spells cannot move)
  - Movement
  - Melee

## Attack Rolls
- Attackers roll a d20 for melee or ranged attacks
- Add bonuses or negatives, such as:
  - strengh bonuses for melee
  - dexterity bonuses for ranged
  - magical bonuses due to magic weapons or spells
- Once you have your total, review your "to-hit" chart to determine success.
  - Lower Armor Class (AC) is better, no armor or shield is an Ac of 9
  - for a level 1 fighter to hit someone with 2 AC they need an attack roll of 17.
- On a successful hit you roll your weapons damage die.
  - You may have modifiers to the damage roll
  - Reduce the opponents HP by this much
  - If they are reduced to 0 or below, they are dead

# Basic Combat (Holmes)
- Initiative is based on dexterity, highest goes first
- Standard roll 1d20 "to hit" with modifiers
- Damage is a d6 with bonuses based on strength
- Execptional actions
  - If an attacker has surpise or approaches grom behind, they always goes first
  - Breaking off melee (retreating) give +2 to the attacker, retreating player loses shield bonus
  - Parry instead of attack, -2 to attackers "to-hit" roll.
    - If parrying player is still hit, *their weapon is destroyed*!

# Basic Combat (BX)
Roughly the same, except with rules for defensive movement, cover against missiles, and holy water and oil attacks.
- Defensive Movements, declared *before* initiative
  - Fighting Withdrawl, backing up slowly during combat, up to 1/2 normal movement rate
  - Retreat, backward movement over 1/2 movement rate
    - Those retreating do not attack
    - Those retreating do not gain shield bonuses to AC
    - Attackers gain +2 on "to hit" rolls against retreating opponents
- Attack rolls of 20 are always a hit, 1's are always a miss
- Cover adjust the "to hit" number a missile attacker must make for a success.
  - Under complete cover, the target cannot be hit
  - When there is some cover, a DM should adjust the to-hit but 1 to 4 points. 
- Burning oil does 1d8 damage
- Holy water deals 1d8 damage against undead
- Weapon damage is always a 1d6
- If you a player has a two handed weapon, they will always lose the initaitve

# Expert Combat (BX)
The same as basic with some additions
- There are "to hit" charts based on class and level
- Damage is determined by weapon type, unarmed damage is 1-2 points.
- Lance combat is allowed with long spears while on horse back
  - on clear level terrain, and with 20 yards to charge, the charging attacker will deal double damage

# Advanced Combat (1e)
Those in melee combat have one additional option, to parry (as seen in Holmes' Basic).
- Instead performing an attack, a player may perform a parry which removes any Strength "to hit" bonuses from opposing attackers.
- Falling back (akin to BX's fighting withdrawl), can be used in conjuction with a parry action
- Fleeing (akin to BX's retreat) exposes the character to rear attacks, that turn. 
- The DMG has damage bonuses for weapon types vs armor

# Advanced Combat (2e)
- Charging opponents
  - A Character can increase thier movemente rate by 50% and attack with a +2
  - Character loses any dex bonuses to AC
  - Suffer an AC penalty of 1
  - Defenders with polearms, if set against the charge, deal double damage on a successful hit
