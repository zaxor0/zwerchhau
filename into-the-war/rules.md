# Playing the Game
- **Saves**: A Save is a 1d20 roll to avoid danger from a risky action or situation. 
- Save successes are always on under or equal to an appropriate Ability Score.
- For all saves, 1 is always a success and 20 always a failure.

## Turns
- Generally the Players take their turn before any enemies.
- If there is a risk of being surprised, characters must each roll a DEX Save or be unable to act on the first turn.
- On their turn, Players can act in any order they wish.
- In combat, turns are 10 seconds, sometimes called rounds.
- Outside of combat, if you need to track turns, they are 10 minutes of time.

## Actions
- On your turn a character can move and perform an action. An action can be anything from negotiating, to attacking, to fleeing. 
- Depending on the action, you may need a relevant skill, per Referee decision.
- Attacks are detailed below in the **Combat** section.
- For other actions the Referee calls for the character at risk to roll a Save. 
- For example, an attempt to trip an opponent might force them to pass a STR Save to stay on their feet, while an attempt to trick an opponent into surrender may force them to pass a WIL Save or lower their arms. 

\newpage{}
# Combat
1. **Initiative**: Players Roll 1d6, on 1-3 referee acts first, 4-6 players act first.
    - Combat is side versus side; check for initiative winner performs all actions, then the loser acts.
2. **Morale**: For NPCs, required if they lose half their numbers.
3. **Combat Turns**: may move and act (such as attack or reload), double move, or double attack.
    - You have two acts you can perform on your turn; these can be a combination of movement, attacks, reloads.
    - You may perform certain actions twice on your turn: double move or double attack. Bazookas cannot double attack, but you can attack and reload.
    - Instead of moving, you may either become prone or get up from prone, as an action. Prone offers +1 on attack rolls, and +1 DR.
    - Machine guns must be fired while prone, for every 5 continuous attacks they must halt for 1 round to cool down.
4. **Range**: Determine if target is within your weapons range.
5. **Attack Roll**: Roll 1d6, on a 1-2 you miss your target. Otherwise roll damage.
6. **Expend Ammo**: Tally of shots or bursts fired per weapon (optional).
    - Optionally, use Shots and Bursts to track when a reload action is needed.
    - If you are tracking shots and bursts, reloading is a standard action. You may move and reload, or reload and act (such as attack).
7. **Damage Roll**: Roll your weapons damage dice; reduce total due to any DR, deal damage to enemy's HP.
    - Grenades and Bazookas cause **Blast** damage, which has a radius of 20 feet.
    - Grenades and Bazookas can pierce armor, **AP**, and ignore half DR when dealing damage.
    - For bazooka or grenade versus a tank, on an attack roll of 6, players may forgo damage to HP and instead disable the tank's movement. 
8. **Pierce Armor**: On a successful attack, if using an AP weapon, permanently reduce the targets DR by 2.
    - Combat ends whenever one side is eliminated or one side flees successfully.

\newpage{}
## Damage to Players
- **Damage**: When an individual takes Damage they lose that many hp. If they have no hp left, they are wounded, and any remaining Damage is removed from their STR score. They must then pass a STR Save to avoid Critical Damage. 
- **Critical Damage**: A character that takes Critical Damage is unable to take further action until they are tended to by an ally and have a Short Rest. If they are left for an hour without being tended to, they die. 
- **Scars Table**: If you take critical damage, roll 1d6 on the **Scars Table**.
- **Ability Score Loss**: If a character has their STR score reduced to zero they are dead. If their DEX or WIL are reduced to zero the character is paralysed or mentally broken respectively, and cannot act until they have a Full Rest. 
- **Death**: When a character dies the Player creates a new character and the Referee finds a way to have them join the group as soon as possible. Here, quickness is required over realism. Alternatively the Player may control a Hireling or Member of their Company.

## Moral
- Groups require a WIL Save to avoid being routed when they lose half of their total numbers.
- Groups with a leader may use the leader's WIL score in place of their own.
- Lone combatants must pass this Save when they are reduced to 0hp, this applies to opponents and allies but not Player characters.
- Fleeing to safety under pursuit requires a DEX Save and somewhere to withdraw to.

## Scars Table

| Roll | Scar, Effect                                          |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|  1   | For whom the bell tolls, lose -1 max HP               |
|  2   | Long term injury, reduce max slots by 2, for 4 weeks  |
|  3   | Shell Shocked, make a moral check on your next combat |
|  4   | Minor brush with death, gain +1 max HP                |
|  5   | Purple Heart, gain 1d4 additional max HP              |
|  6   | The grim reaper, gain 1d6 additional max HP           |

## Healing & Resting
- Outside of combat, players may rest to heal.
- **Short Rest**: Spend 30 minutes resting, gain 1d6 HP. 
- **Full Rest**: 1 week of downtime, restores all HP and ability scores.
- **Deprived**: Somebody deprived of a crucial need (e.g. food, water, or warmth) cannot benefit from Rests.

# Light and Vision

# Luck Rolls
- Sometimes you’ll want an element of randomness without rolling a Save, particularly in situations dictated by luck or those that fall outside of the three Ability Scores. 
- For these type of situations roll a d6. A high roll favours the Players, and a low roll means bad luck for the Players. 
- The Referee decides what a specific result means for the situation at hand. 

# Ranks
- Whenever you successfully perform 2 missions you rank up.
- Whenever you rank you can gain 1 more skill.
