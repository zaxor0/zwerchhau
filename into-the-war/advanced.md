# Distance and Weapon Ranges
- There are 5 bands of ranges normally used in combat:
    - **Close**: Roughly within 5 feet.
    - **Near**: Between 5 and 100 feet.
    - **Far**: Between 101 and 300 feet.
    - **Distant**: Between 301 and 1500 feet.
    - **Extreme**: Between 1501 and 3000 feet.
- Melee weapons can only be used in close range, unless thrown.
- You may use weapons outside thier normal ranges.
- Firing weapons outside their normal range, gives -1 to attack per band.

\newpage{}

# Playing the Game
- **Saves**: A Save is a 1d20 roll to avoid danger from a risky action or situation. 
- Save successes are always on under or equal to an appropriate Ability Score.
- For all saves, 1 is always a success and 20 always a failure.

## Missions
- Gameplay is not necessarily frontline combat; rather bespoke missions.
- Scenarios are normally mission driven, with a clear objective.
- Mission objectives are intended to aid the allies on the war fronts.

## Turns
- Generally, outside of combat, the Players take their turn before any enemies.
- Outside of combat, if you need to track turns, they are 10 minutes of time.
- If there is a risk of being surprised, characters must each roll a DEX Save or be unable to act on the first turn.
- On their turn, Players can act in any order they wish.
- In combat, turns are 10 seconds, sometimes called rounds.

## Actions
- On your turn a character can move and perform an action. An action can be anything from negotiating, to attacking, to fleeing. 
- Depending on the action, you may need a relevant skill, per Referee decision.
- Attacks are detailed below in the **Combat** section.
- For other actions the Referee calls for the character at risk to roll a Save. 
- For example, an attempt to trip an opponent might force them to pass a STR Save to stay on their feet, while an attempt to trick an opponent into surrender may force them to pass a WIL Save or lower their arms. 

## Ranks
- Whenever you successfully perform 2 missions you rank up.
- Whenever you rank you can gain 1 more skill, with training.
- Gained skills require 1 month of time in training.
- Optionally, if you performed an activity similar to the desired skill while on recent a mission, you can train in 2 weeks instead.

\newpage{}
# Combat
1. **Surprise**: If one side catches the other off guard, each on that side may perform 1 action before initative.
    - If an enemy is completely unaware of your presence and you are in **close** range with a deadly weapon, roll 1d6 to instantly kill. On a 1 the kill attempt fails and initiative begins.
2. **Initiative**: Players roll 1d6: on 1-3 referee acts first, 4-6 players act first.
    - Combat is side versus side; initiative winner performs the below first.
3. **Morale**: Only when required, a WIL Save to avoid being routed.
    - Required for NPCs if they lose half their numbers.
5. **Combat Turns**: For your side, each player does the following:
    - **Declarations**: Commit to two actions prior to any movement or rolls.
    - **Actions**: Any combination of movement, attack, or reload.
    - Other actions may be taken at referee discretion, such as use a radio.
    - If your target dies before you roll attack, make a **Luck Roll** to see if you can change targets.
6. **Movement**: A movement action covers up to 50 feet of ground. 
    - As a movement, you can become **prone** or get up from prone; being prone gives +1 on attack rolls, and +1 DR.
    - **Retreat** or **routed**, move up to 150 feet but enemies gain +1 to attack rolls against you. No other actions may be taken.
7. **Range**: Determine if target is within your weapons range.
8. **Attack Roll**: Roll 1d6, a 1 or 2 is a miss. 3 to 6 is a hit.
    - If 3 attacks target the same 10 foot area, enemies in that space are **pinned down** and take -2 on their next attack.
    - Machine guns must be fired while prone or mounted on a surface. For every 5 continuous attacks they must halt for 1 round to cool down.
9. **Expend Ammo**: Tally attacks fired per ranged weapon.
10. **Damage Roll**: Roll your weapons damage dice; reduce total due to any DR, deal damage to enemy's HP.
    - **Hand to hand** combat without a weapon deals 1d4 damage.
    - For weapons that cause **Blast** damage, roll for each person in a 20 ft.
    - For weapons with **AP** (armor piercing) ignore half DR rounded up.
    - For bazooka or grenade versus a tank, on an attack roll of 6, players may forgo damage to HP and instead disable the tank's movement. 
11. **Pierce Armor**: On a successful attack, if using an **AP** weapon, permanently reduce the targets DR by 2.
12. Combat ends whenever one side is eliminated or one side flees successfully, else return to step 2 and repeat.

\newpage{}

## Morale
- Groups require a WIL Save to avoid being routed when they lose half of their total numbers.
- Groups with a leader may use the leader's WIL score in place of their own.
- Lone combatants must pass this Save when they are reduced to 0hp, this applies to opponents and allies but not Player characters.
- Fleeing to safety under pursuit requires a DEX Save and somewhere to withdraw to. 

## Damage to Players
- **Damage**: When an individual takes Damage they lose that many hp. If they have no hp left, they are wounded, and any remaining Damage is removed from their STR score. They must then pass a STR Save to avoid Critical Damage. 
- **Critical Damage**: A character that takes Critical Damage is unable to take further action until they are tended to by an ally and have a Short Rest. If they are left for an hour without being tended to, they die. 
- **Scars Table**: If you take critical damage, roll 1d6 on the **Scars Table**.
- **Ability Score Loss**: If a character has their STR score reduced to zero they are dead. If their DEX or WIL are reduced to zero the character is paralysed or mentally broken respectively, and cannot act until they have a Full Rest. 
- **Death**: When a character dies the Player creates a new character and the Referee finds a way to have them join the group as soon as possible. Here, quickness is required over realism. Alternatively the Player may control a Hireling or Member of their Company.
- **Poison** usually causes Ability Score loss.
- Effects like Blindness will Impair attacks and call for Saves to carry out usually simple actions.

## Scars Table

| Roll | Scar, Effect                                          |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|  1   | For Whom the Bell Tolls, lose -1 max HP               |
|  2   | Old War Wound, reduce max slots by 2, for 4 weeks     |
|  3   | Shell Shocked, make a moral check on your next combat |
|  4   | Brush with Death, gain +1 max HP                      |
|  5   | Purple Heart, gain 1d4 additional max HP              |
|  6   | The Grim Reaper, gain 1d6 additional max HP           |

\newpage{}

# Healing & Resting
- Outside of combat, players may rest to heal.
- **Short Rest**: Spend 30 minutes resting, gain 1d6 HP. 
- **Full Rest**: 1 week of downtime, restores all HP and ability scores.
- **Deprived**: Somebody deprived of a crucial need (e.g. food, water, or warmth) cannot benefit from Rests.
- First aid kits can heal 2 STR, medic's kits can heal all STR.

# Communcations
- Players are skilled in hand signal communication, ideal for combat or stealth. 
- Hand signals are only dimished by visibility, see **Light and Vision**.
- At referee's discretion, communications in combat may require a WIL save.
- Vocal and radio comms are easily obfuscated by gunfire and explosions. 
- Radios cannot be used while handling a weapon; using one in combat gives the enemy +1 on hits against you, if you are visible.
- Handheld radios are usable within a 1 mile radius of other allied radios; backpacks radios have a radius of 3 miles.

# Light and Vision
- **Combat visibility**: Ability see enemy targets or an ally's hand signals.
- During the day, combat visibility is limited up to **Distant** ranges.
- At day, Scopes and Binoculars easily let someone see **Extreme** range.
- At night, combat visibility is decreased to **Near** range.
- At night, Scopes and Binoculars easily let someone see **Distant** range.
- Someone creating a light at night (e.g. lighting a cigarette) is an easy target; visibility of someone doing so is treated as if during the day.

# Luck Rolls
- Sometimes you’ll want an element of randomness without rolling a Save, particularly in situations dictated by luck or those that fall outside of the three Ability Scores. 
- For these type of situations roll a d6. A high roll favours the Players, and a low roll means bad luck for the Players. 
- The Referee decides what a specific result means for the situation at hand. 

\newpage{}
# Enemies & NPCs
- The following table applies to all NPCs, whether ally or enemy.
- All enemies and NPCs have 10s for their stat block; STR, DEX, WIL.
- Enemies are less well trained than players, they hit on 4-6 on a 1d6.
- Enemies normal range of fire is **far** unless otherwise noted.
- Damage dealt to enemies reduces HP, death occurs at 0 HP for them.
- Enemies are unlikely to run out of ammo, they only do at Referee discretion.
- Vehicles can move up to 200 feet in 1 movement action.
- If a vehicle is brought to 0 HP it no longer functions and is non-repairable.
- Tank attacks with their main gun deals bast damage, but their MG attack only deals 3d8 of normal damage.
- Tanks, amored cars, and some Jeeps have machine guns, a **MG**.
- **MG**, machine guns, deal 3d8 damage; on tanks represent a second attack.
- For bazooka or grenade versus a tank, on an attack roll of 6, players may forgo damage to HP and instead disable the tank's movement.
