# Playing the Game
- **Saves**: A Save is a 1d20 roll to avoid danger from a risky action or situation. 
- Save successes are always on under or equal to an appropriate Ability Score.
- For all saves, 1 is always a success and 20 always a failure.

## Turns
- Generally the Players take their turn before any enemies.
- If there is a risk of being surprised, characters must each roll a DEX Save or be unable to act on the first turn.
- On their turn, Players can act in any order they wish.

## Actions
- On your turn a character can move and perform an action. An action can be anything from negotiating, to attacking, to fleeing. 
- Going prone or getting up from prone is equivalent to a movement.
- For other actions the Referee calls for the character at risk to roll a Save. 
- For example, an attempt to trip an opponent might force them to pass a STR Save to stay on their feet, while an attempt to trick an opponent into surrender may force them to pass a WIL Save or lower their arms. 

## Attacks
- An attacker rolls a die dictated by their weapon, and subtracts the opponent's Armour score. Their attack causes this much Damage.
- Range weapons cannot be used in melee, but can be used as improvised clubs with 1d4 damage.
- Attacks that are Impaired, such as firing through cover, or fighting while grappled, roll 1d4 Damage regardless of weapon. 
- Similarly, attacks that are Enhanced by a risky stunt or a helpless or vulnerable target, roll double damage dice.

## Morale
- Groups require a WIL Save to avoid being routed when they lose half of their total numbers.
- Groups with a leader may use the leader's WIL score in place of their own.
- Lone combatants must pass this Save when they are reduced to 0hp, this applies to opponents and allies but not Player characters.
- Fleeing to safety under pursuit requires a DEX Save and somewhere to withdraw to. 

## Damage to Players
- **Damage**: When an individual takes Damage they lose that many hp. If they have no hp left, they are wounded, and any remaining Damage is removed from their STR score. They must then pass a STR Save to avoid Critical Damage. 
- **Critical Damage**: A character that takes Critical Damage is unable to take further action until they are tended to by an ally and have a Short Rest. If they are left for an hour without being tended to, they die. 
- **Ability Score Loss**: If a character has their STR score reduced to zero they are dead. If their DEX or WIL are reduced to zero the character is paralysed or mentally broken respectively, and cannot act until they have a Full Rest. 
- **Death**: When a character dies the Player creates a new character and the Referee finds a way to have them join the group as soon as possible. Here, quickness is required over realism. Alternatively the Player may control a Hireling or Member of their Company.
- **Poison** usually causes Ability Score loss. 
- Effects like Blindness will Impair attacks and call for Saves to carry out usually simple actions. 

## Healing & Resting
- Outside of combat, players may rest to heal.
- **Short Rest**: Spend 30 minutes resting, gain 1d6 HP. 
- **Full Rest**: 1 week of downtime, restores all HP and ability scores.
- **Deprived**: Somebody deprived of a crucial need (e.g. food, water, or warmth) cannot benefit from Rests.
- First aid kits can heal 2 STR, medic's kits can heal all STR.

\newpage{}
## Communcations
- Players are skilled in hand signal communication, ideal for combat or stealth. 
- Hand signals are only dimished by visibility.
- Vocal and radio comms are easily obfuscated by gunfire and explosions. 
- Radios cannot be used while handling a weapon.
- Handheld radios have a working radius of 1 mile, backpacks radios 3 miles.

## Light and Vision
- Scopes and Binoculars easily let someone see **twice** as far as normal.
- At night, you can see **half** as far as normal.
- At night, Scopes and Binoculars easily let someone see a normal distance.
- Someone creating a light at night (e.g. lighting a cigarette) is an easy target.

## Luck Rolls
- Sometimes you’ll want an element of randomness without rolling a Save, particularly in situations dictated by luck or those that fall outside of the three Ability Scores. 
- For these type of situations roll a d6. A high roll favours the Players, and a low roll means bad luck for the Players. 
- The Referee decides what a specific result means for the situation at hand. 

\newpage{}
# Enemies & NPCs
- The following table applies to all NPCs, whether ally or enemy.
- All enemies and NPCs have 10s for their stat block; STR, DEX, WIL.
- Damage dealt to enemies reduces HP, death occurs at 0 HP for them.
- Tanks, amored cars, and some Jeeps have machine guns, a **MG**.
- Tanks get 2 attacks per turn, 1 main gun and one **MG**.

| Enemy             | HP | Damage per Attack |
|-------------------|----|-------------------|
| Solider           | 7  | 1d8 + 1           |
| Sergeant          | 9  | 1d8 + 2           |
| Sniper            | 8  | 2d8               |

| Jeep, with MG     | 12 | 3d8               |

| Heavy Tank        | 60 | 8d8, 3d8          |

# Area Effect Attacks
Some attacks, from artillery, planes, or mortars, may harm player characters, the following rules attempt to account for those events. All of these attacks require a DEX save for half damage.

| Attack Type            | Damage |
|------------------------|--------|
| Artillery              | 6d8    |
| Mortar fire            | 4d8    |
| Dive Bombers           | 4d8    |
| Airplane Strafing Runs | 3d8 +1 |
| Naval Bombardment      | 8d8    |

# Optional Rules
- **Language Proficiencies**: For each secondary language, roll 1d6: 1-2 spoken only, 3-4 spoken & written, 5-6 fluent.
- **Attack Rolls**: Roll 1d6 to attack, miss on 1s and 2s.
- **Distance**: If you are very far from your target, take -1 on attacks, if using attack rolls.
- **Pin Down**: 3 attacks on a 10 foot area forces the occupying opponents to lose their next attack.
