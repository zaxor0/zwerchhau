A simple OSR inspired TTRPG with a focus on combat

- Simplicity, traits inspired by Oz Browning's OZR
- Classes and Spells inspired by D&D
- Magical effects inspired by Dungeon Crawl Classics
- Combat, Magic, Skills inspired by conversations with Gronka

## Serve the game
DMs and players both have have a duty to serve the game, to make the overall experience of this game enjoyable. What enjoyable is, exactly, is not easy to define; however, there are a few items to consider:

- Set expectations; what is the world like, what are the people like?
  - Some worlds are dangerous, some people are distrustful, some places are scary; a DM has a duty to their players to give them sign posts about these details.
- Accept failures; trails, tribulations, can help gameplay as long as they give players opportunities to continue to develop their characters.
  - Consider the [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey)

## Dice and Checks

The bulk of this system will use D6s for checks and spells; damage will be done with other dice depending on weapons used.

| Roll | Result        | Example opening a locked door                                        |
|------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Major Failure | your lock pick breaks, as does the lock                              |
| 2    | Minor Failure | your lock pick is damaged somewhat                                   |
| 3    | Mixed Results | the lock is damaged but the door will open                           |
| 4    | Mixed Results | the door is unlocked, but cannot be opened quietly                   |
| 5    | Minor Success | the door is unlocked and opens quietly & with ease                   |
| 6    | Major Success | the door is unlocked and you are now more adept at this kind of lock |

A 3 should skew to slightly less good results and 4 should skew to slightly better results, at the DM's discretion.

### Advantage
If your character is skilled in the specific task at hand, you will roll with advantage. Advantage means roll 2d6 and pick the better of the two.

### Relevant Ability Scores & Failure Checks
If you have a relevant ability score of a 5 or 6, a roll of 1 is not necessarily a major failure. You will need to roll again to "confrim the failure" which occurs on a 1 or 2.

- 1's become minor failures, with a check for major failure. 
  - Roll a "failure confirmation," 1d6 where a 1 or 2 results in a major failure.
- 2's becomes mixed results, but not entirely in your favor

Examples of relevant abilities for tasks are:

- Dexterity for a climb check
- Strength for a lift check
- Intelligence for a research check

The relevance of an ability is determined by the DM, who should give this information to the player prior to a roll. For instance, if the player is strong and wants to lift 200 Lbs. then they have a relevant ability score; however, if this same player tries to lift 1000 Lbs. then they do not have a relevant ability bonus.

### Defining Success
When there are difficult checks to be made, and the ideal results may be beyond the bounds of a characters a skill, a DM should give the players an idea what a "success" would generally look like.

Building tension is an excellent tool for engaging gameplay, but its important to temper player expectations on exceptionally difficult tasks. 

Since some tasks would simply be outside the ability of a player, a "success" may just be the best case scenario given their abilities. 

As an example, if a player has a high strength and wants to "kick down an iron door," but would not be physically capable due to the iron reinforcements, the DM should inform the player that "at best the player will damage the door, but they could not alone break it down."

We do not necessarily need to give players negative modifiers to prevent them from performing a ridiculous task (solving a quantum equation in minutes), but *we do need* to give them an idea of what they are capable of in the *best possible case*.

As a last note and recommendation, while a DM should give the idea of possible successes, this should be around a 5 in terms of the die roll as a 6 might give unique or interesting bonuses that themselves should be a surpise.

## Abilities
Like traditional D&D, players should roll their ability scores. It is recommended to roll "down the line‚Äù where each rolls is not arranged according to preference. 

For each of the 4 abilities, *roll 2d6* and keep the best number.

- Strength
- Dexterity
- Will
- Intelligence
- Charisma

### Constitution 
Constituion is total sum of Strength, Dexterity, Will, and your current level. Used in combat, it represents your total ability to persevere and survive. The majority of damage in combat is against your constitution, not your flesh and blood. This means that you risk being exhausted and overwhelmed when you take constitution damage.

If your constitution reaches 0, you do not die. However, you collapse and are not reliably able to defend yourself against attacks.

### Intelligence
This represents your ability to learn and both informal and formal education. Half this number and round up, this represents additional skills you receive advantage on. You may also choose to use one of these points on additional languages, instead of skills.

### Charisma
Charisma rolls are to be rarely used in this system; ideally they are reserved for critical moments or where serious harm could occur. However, these checks should be accompanied by role playing.

As a role playing game, dialogue is considered a core feature; as such, reducing social interactions to points or rolls limits experience of play in regards to this "core" feature. 

Examples of good charisma checks:
- A fighter needs to rally her mercenary allies 
- A rogue needs to con their way out of a likely torture or death

Examples of bad charisma checks:
- A bard wants to seduce a maiden
- A wizard wants to convince a duke to betray his lover

Not all players prefer to role play as their character, but in dialogue based interactions players should come up with details on how or what they do while interacting with NPCs. Simple saying "I want to convince the king to hire us" provides less flavor for everyone else at the table than saying "My character, points out his noble lineage of the House of Swarsington, provides examples of loyalty to the throne (including a list of battles), in order to sway the king to hire us."

This system assumes that a player's character should be however charismatic they want them to be. That does not mean they can charm their way into anything, but any attempt to do so better serves gameplay with thoughtful and engaging dialogue. 

What is a successful charismatic action then? This ultimately should be up to the DM, who should have some concept of what a given NPC might find convincing or not. 

If a check is needed, simply roll "behind the scenes." If a player has relevant skills, diplomacy, lying, or is knowledgeable on the topic at hand, consider giving them advantage.  

### Wisdom
All players start with 1 wisdom.

Wisdom is earned through gameplay, the DM should keep track of:

- Moment where players succeed in an impressive fashion
- Moments where players fail but learn something important about the world or game.

Each of these would grant players involved a point of wisdom.

Wisdom is a resource that can be spent...

### Hit points and Death
All player characters have 6 hit points, this does not increase with leveling. Often the rules refer to damage to flesh, this is damage to your hit points--as opposed to damage to your constitution. 

If a player character has less than zero hit points, they are dead; this is the case whether or not they have any CON points left.

## Background or Heritage 
The Dungeon Master has the last say in allowed heritage or backgrounds (races as is referred to older D&D editions). It is advisable to have limits on player physical size and capacity for flight and speed. In the unlikely event of a game breaking mechanic a DM reservers the right to reduce the power of a unique ability created by a player. Within the limits defined by their DM, players may freely choose any fantasy heritage that they deem that best suits their intended identity.  Some backgrounds could be unbalanced\*, the following table is just a suggestion.

| Classic  | Expanded   | Modern\*    |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Human    | Half Orc   | Half Giant  |
| Elf      | Half Elf   | Dragonborn  |
| Dwarf    | Gnome      | Tiefling    |
| Halfling |            | Fairy       |

### Pick Two Traits
Traits in this rule set are considered a _broad characteristic_, unlike skills which would apply to specific tasks.
For whatever background a player picks, they should decide 2 traits that describe them (and their people generally) that would effect gameplay.
Examples:

- Dwarf : strong, resistant to poison, stout
- Elf : wise, quick, magic-adept
- Human : quick learned, open minded, strong, quick
- Halfling : sly, quick, stealthy, hungry

Player example: "My character is a tall burly human from the desert region, my people are known for being (1) well educated and (2) stealthy"

Whenever a player has to perform a check that their background would be relevant for, they are able to roll advantage, meaning roll two dice and pick the one they want.

## Skills
Skills are specific abilities that a given player would have, they are more focused than traits and represent your personal experience and training. Except for DM discretion, there are generally no limits to what a skill could be. 

A DM has the right to reject a skill for being too broad. An example of a badly chosen skill would be a character who is good at "building;" structures are build out of a variety of material and techniques, a more appropriate choice would be carpentry or masonry.

All characters have a number of skills based on their intelligence, (Int / 2, rounded up); additionally some classes provide more skills, as does leveling in a class.

Besides during combat, most things *should not* require a skill check. Climbing up an old stonewall, negotiating prices in a market, dressing a wound, are not the sort of things that you would need to have a skill check in. Rather, if a check for a common / general task is *needed* a DM should defer to an ability check.

Skill checks are required when specialized experience or knowledge is required; specifically if failure of the task would lead to terrible consequences. Such as pick pocketing the kings purse, or forging a nobles signature, organizing the constuction of fortified defenses.

Even then, with specialized skills being required, group efforts to resolve a problem with coherent dialog between players should generally trump a skill check. As long as the plan is detailed, concievable, and somewhat reasonable, players should be able to execute complex tasks without pedantic skill checks.

### Sample Combat Skills
These skills are mentioned because they are specifically referenced in the combat rules and would be appropriate for any player interested in combat.

- Grappling
- Wrestling throws
- Disarming
- Improvised weaponry
- Defensive melee combat
- Firing into Melee

### Sample Non-Combat Skills
|Samples| | |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Carpentry   | Sailing          | Library Research       |
| Bartering   | Lock Picking     | Specialized Knowledge  |
| Fletching   | Forgery          | Diplomacy              |
| Smithing    | Mountaineering   |                        |
| Tanning     | Construction     |                        |

## Classes
There are 4 classes based on classic D&D archtypes. While players may pick anything as a subclass as the focal identity of their character, they should try to stay within one of the classes. Classes guide leveling and character advancement.

- Warriors : Someone with advanced combat training
- Rogues : Someone with keen skills or intuition: slyness, discreteness, cleverness, back stabbing
- Magic-Users : Someone with spellcasting abilities, gained from study, natural adeptness to magic, or supernatural influence
- Priests : Someone with spellcasting-like abilities that are inspired by a holy deity or supernatural presence (personified or not)

Players should pick a subclass or identity that falls under one of these types. This is completely open ended, players are free to come up with any kind of identity. Here are some examples:

- Warrior : Streetfighter, Kung Fu Master, Gladiator, Paladin, Ranger, Knight, Swordsman, Samurai, Crossbowmen, Archer
- Rogues : Thief, Bard, Assassin, Scout, Swashbuckler, Detective
- Magic-Users : Mage, Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Witch, Necromancer, Illusionist, Sage
- Priest : Druid, Cleric, Monk, Preacher, Cultist

Players should develop a clear idea of what background, training, or expierence they have.

### Warriors
Warriors start with 1 weapon specialization, players may freely pick any weapon that suits their intended character identity.
This gives them the following abilities with their chosen weapon:

- For combat with their chosen weapon, they may riposte for full damage on a major success parry roll [6].
- For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, advantage roll for damage
- For bows, two ranged attacks per round ranged combat rules.

For every even level as a warrior (2,4,6,etc.) they may gain either:

- 1 additional weapon specialization, they gain the above abilities for this weapon.
- 1 combat weapon feat. This is like a skill but it pertains to just 1 weapon type. Players should be creative here and work with their DM. Examples include:
  - Swift attack, gain +1 attacks with weapon against a single target during combat (recommended limit of +2)
  - Heavy attack, deal +1 constitution damage
  - Lethal attack, deal +1 flesh/HP damage on 6's
  - Cleaving attack, upon delivering a killing blow to a standing target, additional "unused" damage may be applied to an adjacent target.

Starting at level 2, warriors may gain henchmen who are willing to adventure with the party for a portion of the treasure. They are additional fighters with melee weapon and follow tactical orders given by the player character. Their basic stats are, 6HP, 10 Con, and they only deal 1d6 damage.

#### Henchmen Progression
| Level |  Max Count | Loyalty |
|-------|------------|---------|
|   1   |      0     |    -    |
|   2   |      1     |    4    |
|   3   |      2     |    5    |
|   4   |      2     |    6    |
|   5   |      3     |    7    |
|   6   |      3     |    8    |
|   7   |      3     |    9    |
|   8   |      4     |    10   |
|   9   |      4     |    11   |
|   10  |      4     |    12   |
|   11  |      5     |    13   |
|   12  |      5     |    14   |
|   13  |      5     |    15   |
|   14  |      6     |    16   |

### Rogues
Rogues starts with 3 skill specializations, they may pick any **specific** skill or task to have an advantage on performing. This is more narrow than the background traits. Generally this should follow a rogue-ish motif, but with a good character concept a player should not feel limited. Examples include:

- Sneaking: players are talented at moving around in a hidden fashion and hiding in shadows
- Lock picking: players are exceptional at opening a variety of locks
- Sleight of hand: players are talented at being physically misleading and trickery
- Lying / verbal deception: players are exceptional at spinning falsehoods to unknowing victims
- Seduction: players exude charisma and physical attraction, NPCs have a disadvantage when trying to resist player suggestions

Back Stab: 
- This is a special attacks only Rogues (but not Bards) may have.
- Only applicable to weapons the player character is specailized in.
- The weapon must be in hand, if the player is not hidden they must pass a sleight of hand check on a 5 ot 6. 
- Before combat occurs, a rogue may perform 1 attack where the damage roll is fully applied to HP and not to CON.

Weapon Specialization:
- For combat with their chosen weapon, they may riposte for full damage on a major success parry roll [6].
- For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, advantage roll for damage
- For bows, two ranged attacks per round ranged combat rules.

For every even level as a rogue (2,4,6,etc.) they may gain one of:

- one additional skill, rogueish or relevant to their character's experience
- one additional advantage die for a given skill, limit of +2. For instance, sleight of hand +2 means roll 3 die pick the best roll.
- one additional weapon specialization, limit of 2 total.

#### Bards
A Bard starts with 2 skill specializations instead of 3, may never have more than 1 weapon specialization, and gains additional skills every 3rd level. 
- May never have back stab

|   13  |  3 3 3 3 1     |
|   14  |  3 3 3 3 2     |

### Magic-Users
Mages know 1 spell at level 1 and can cast up to 1 spell a day. Additionally, Mages gain 1 skill based on their subclass. This could be knowldged based, experience based, training based, etc. Some example include:

- Knowledge of local history
- speak an ancient language fluently
- skilled in diplomatic policies
- skilled in debate
- Strategic warfare
- Mercantile economics

|   13  |  4 4 4 3 3 3   |
|   14  |  4 4 4 4 3 3   |

### Priests
Priests are distinguished from magic-users becuase they *believe* (with or without good justification) that their magical abilities are both:

- attuned to a moral or natural order of the universe
- only possible due to a supernatural influence

The ability of a priest to case a healing spell, for example, is evidence to them that their moral / religious/ supernatural based beliefs are objectively correct. 

There are two types of priests, "holy warriors" who fight for their gods / beliefs and "holy ritualists" who channel divine powers and perform rituals.

#### Holy Warriors
- Do not gain spell abilities at level 1, they gain them at level 2 after proving their faith
- Never gain the ability to perform rituals
- Can turn the undead
- Have 1 weapon specialization
- Skilled in tending the wounded

#### Holy Ritualists
- Start with 1 spell known, 1 cast per day
- Can perform ritual versions of a spell over the course of 1 hour, without "casting" them.
- Can turn the undead
- Skilled in tending the wounded

|   14  |   6 5 5 5 4    |

\*Only a holy ritualist gains a spell at first level, not a holy warrior.

## Equipment

### Weapons

#### Melee
| Size        | Damage | Examples                                                    |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Small       | 1d4    | club, dagger, dart, improvised weapon                       |
| Medium      | 1d6    | short sword, rapier, quarter staff, handaxe, mace, 1h spear |
| Long, Heavy | 1d8    | 1h longsword, 1h battleaxe, greatclub, flail                |
| Two Handed  | 2d6    | 2h longsword, 2h battleaxe, 2h spear                        |
| Great       | 1d12   | greatsword, great axe, heavy polearms                       |

#### Great Weapons 
These are heavy, oversized, two handed weapons. Therefore, without proper training and strength, they are slower to use. To use one without penalty, you must:

- Have a specialization in with a specific great weapon
- have a 6 in strength

If you do not meet both of these requirements, then suffer a -1 on Dex related combat result checks.
Lastly, you may *not use dex* for slash related combat checks.

#### Ranged

| Size        | Damage | Examples                |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------|
| Small       | 1d4    | hand crossbow           |
| Medium      | 1d6    | crossbow, short bow     |
| Long, Heavy | 1d8    | longbow, heavy crossbow |

- Crossbows can only ever fire once per combat round
- With weapon specialization, bows may fire twice per round.

It is recommended to not allow longbows in standard combat; instead short bows should be used in most scenarios. This rules system has a prejudice against longbows, as historically they would from great distances in large scale battles and not the squad style combat seen in most table top RPGs. Ultimately, it is up to the discretion of the DM

### Armor

Armor reduces the damage of successful attacks that deal damage to HP only. However, in combat, any type damage cannot reduced to 0; meaning, at least 1 point of damage must be dealt to either flesh or constitution.

| Size   | Defense | Examples                    |
|--------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Light  |   -1    | leather, studded leather    |
| Medium |   -2    | chainmail, beastplate, hide |
| Heavy  |   -3    | platemail, scalemail        |

- Without a skill in "combat with heavy armor," combatants burn an additional 1 CON for each round of melee.

#### Shields
Whether a buckler, heater, or tower shield, all shields provide:
- +1 bonus to parry
- -1 Con Damage per turn of melee combat

# Combat
Combat in Zwerhhau is meant to be swift, deadly, and decisive. 

It is a ritual well practiced by adventurers.

## Melee Combat Loop
Melee combat is exhausting, each round requires that the sides engaged lose 2 Constitution.

- Declare engagement posture
- Determine Player's Attacking Combat Action
- DM Rolls for NPC's action
- Determine the opposed check based on results (dex, str, or both)
- Opposed Roll - Add the relevant ability (dex, str)
  - Highest wins, note winner's value, reroll on equal values. 
- Damage Roll - Winner rolls their weapon's damage dice
  - Reduce HP damage based on armor
  - Check for death
  - Apply damage bonuses
- Reduce Constituion Points, 2 per round of combat
  - If player is wearing heavy armor and unskilled, reduce CON by 1 further. 

### Engagement Posture
In the thick of combat, the blows may turn to a grapple. Prior to attack players may choose their default posture, to engage in grapple or to disengage. 

If their default posture is to disengage, they gain a +1 to win a grapple challenge but do not enter the grapple.

### Combat Actions
Players decide which type of attack based on the following:

- Thrusts: Piercing actions
  - Additional damage (+1 Con) for 1h spears
  - Additional damage (+2 Con) for 2h spears
  - Additional damage (+1 HP) for 2h swords
- Slashes / Cuts: Swinging & slicing actions
  - Additional damage (+2 Con) for any medium, long, two-handed, or great weapon
  - Additional damage (+1 Con) for blunt great weapons
  - Additional damage (+1 HP) for sharp-edged great weapons
- Parries: blocking the blow of a weapon with your weapon
  - An opposed roll of natural 6 allows for a riposte
  - Gain +1 to your roll if you have a shield
- Ripostes: a free follow up attack after a parry opposed roll of 6, half damage
  - With weapon specialization, does normal damage
- Dodges: evading an attack with quick movement
  - Allow for bonus to escape
- Grapples: clinging to your opponent to attempt a wrestling maneuvre, with or without your weapon
  - Single sided grapple attempts take half damage on failed DEX checks
  - Throw the opponent to the ground, greatly decreases opponent defenses, ideal action for a swift kill
  - Disarm the opponent, ideal to force an opponent to yield
  - Sleeperhold, attempt to force the opponent to passout; if successful, you are occupied for 3 turns and are unable to defend yourself
- Defensive Fighting: Focusing on parries without ripostes, regaining footing when downed. See the below section.

### NPC Combat Attack Roll
One d6 die roll representing the following actions

| Roll | Slashing | Thrusting or Slashing |  Thrusting   |
|------|----------|-----------------------|--------------|
|   1  |  DM Pick |       DM Pick         |  DM Pick     |  
|   2  |  Parry   |       Parry           |  Parry       |
|   3  |  Slash   |       Thrust          |  Thrust      |
|   4  |  Slash   |       Slash           |  Thrust      |
|   5  |  Dodge   |       Dodge           |  Dodge       |
|   6  |  Grapple |       Grapple         |  Grapple     |

### Combat Attack Results

### Opposed Checks
Once you've determined which check will occur, whether strength or dex (or none at all), each side rolls 1d6 + their attribute.

The higher value wins the check and deals damage. 

To succeed in a grapple check, you must first win a dex check to wrestle your opponent, and then a strength check to enter the grapple phase. If both sides attempt a grapple, you only need the strength check.

Opponents attacking someone performing "defensive fighting" still roll, but only "hit" on a 6. See below for more detail.

### Damage Dealt
Damage is dealth based on the die roll of the appropriate weapon; however, damage is split between flesh / HP and Constitution.

| Roll | HP Damage | CON Damage |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 1    |     0     |     1      |
| 2    |     1     |     1      |
| 3    |     1     |     2      |
| 4    |     1     |     3      |
| 5    |     2     |     3      |
| 6    |     2     |     4      |
| 7    |     3     |     4      |
| 8    |     3     |     5      |
| 9    |     4     |     5      |
| 10   |     4     |     6      |
| 11   |     5     |     6      |
| 12   |     6     |     6      |

- Damage to HP (flesh and blood) is always dealt first.
- If HP damage brings the player character below 0 hit points, they are dead.
- If a player character takes damage that brings them to *exactly* zero hit points, they may not necessarily die. Perform the *Will to Live* roll 
- If still alive, add damage bonuses.

### The Will to Live

1. Make a 1d12 *Will to Live* roll. If the player rolls equal to or under thier Will ability score, they are not dead.
2. Next, they must roll on the *Scars, Broken Bones, and Mortal Wounds* table below.
3. The must roll a 1d6, add the result to their maximum HP. 
4. The player character is still at 0 HP but are unconscious.
5. Ignore any damage bonuses, they are out of the fight.
6. Without medical aid soon, they will die.

#### Scars, Broken Bones, and Mortal Wounds

Roll 1d6 
- On a 1-2 you gain a scar
- On a 3-5 you have a broken bone
- On a 6 you have a mortal wound, you will die unless untreated. 

Roll 1d4, see where you have been wounded.

|1d4| Scars (1,2) | Broken Bones (3,4,5) |  Mortal Wounds (6) |
|---|-------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 1 |   Facial    |     Skull            |    Lose an Eye     |
| 2 |   Chest     |     Ribs             |    Punctured Organ |
| 3 |   Arm       |     Arm              |    Lose an arm     |
| 4 |   Leg       |     Leg              |    Lose a leg      |

### Damage Bonuses
Based on the opposed die roll, the victor may deal additional damage to their opponent, to either their HP (flesh and blood) or to their CON (thier overall endurance)

| Roll | Upright Opponent   | Downed Opponent   | 
|------|--------------------|-------------------|
|   1  |  nil               | nil               | 
|   2  |  nil               | +1 Con damage     | 
|   3  |  nil               | +1 Con Damage     | 
|   4  |  +1 Con Damage     | +2 Con Damage     | 
|   5  |  +2 Con Damage     | +1 HP, +1 Con Dmg | 
|   6  |  +1 HP, +1 Con Dmg | +2 HP, +2 Con Dmg | 

#### Attack type bonuses
These are mentioned previously, but to restate:
- Thrusts
  - Additional damage (+1 Con) for 1h spears
  - Additional damage (+2 Con) for 2h spears
  - Additional damage (+1 HP) for 2h swords
- Slashes
  - Additional damage (+2 Con) for any medium, long, two-handed, or great weapon
  - Additional damage (+1 Con) for blunt great weapons
  - Additional damage (+1 HP) for sharp-edged great weapons

### Defensive Fighting
Defensive Fighting occurs in place of an opposed roll. Opponents land hits only on 6s and additional opponents gain bonuses to hit. Players should consider this choice when they need to perform the following:

- Keep enemies at bay
- Parry incoming attacks
- Avoid being encircled
- Regain footing after being knock down

#### Actions for opponents
- Hit the defensive fighter only on a 6
- Do not gain damage bonuses if alone
- For each additional opponent attacking, each attacker gains a +1 to their roll with a maximum of +3. 
- If their are 3 or more opponents attacking the defensive fighter, they deal +1 CON damage each.

### Dodge
On a succesful dodge roll a player suffers no damage from a single attack. Ideally used in 1 on 1 scenarios, otherwise defensive fighting is recommended.

- A player must declare who they are dodging, if there is more than 1 opponent. 
- If they succeed on a 5 or 6, they may attempt to escape if there is a viable route to retreat. 
- On a success and for each additional opponent, they must expend 1 CON to continue dodging with a maximum of 3 CON.
- If there are multiple opponents, and the player does not expend Constitution, opponents land hits on 5s and 6s.

### Grappling and Wrestling
#### One Sided Grapple Attempts
If only one combatant attempts a grapple, there are two checks:

- First dexterity, this represents the lunge or springing action an attacker would make to quickly close distance before a strike is made against them. Also, is represents the opponent swinging their weapon or moving away from the grappler. 
- Upon failure 
  -If the opposing side performed a *thrust* or *slash*, take damage.
- Upon success:
  - opposed dexterity check, a standard opposed strength check to see who dominates.

#### Grapple Strength Check
If both sides are performing a grapple, each side rolls 1d6 & add their strength, winner performs a wrestling maneuvre.

- Disarm the opponent: Attempt to remove the opponent's weapon, this is ideal for forcing a yield. 
- Throw the opponent to the ground: Drastically reduce an opponents defensive capabilities by forcing them into a prone position, this is ideal for a swift kill.
- Sleeperhold: Attempt to force the opponent to passout; if successful, you are occupied for 3 turns and are unable to defend yourself.

These maneurves are the sort of thing a warrior would want to have "skills" in, giving them an "advantage roll."

#### Riposte
If a player rolled a parry versus a slash or thrust, and they win the opposed check with a natural roll of 6, may riposte.

A riposte is follow up to a successful parry that allows for a damage roll halved; with weapon specailization, normal damage is dealt.

A parry roll of 5 with a +1 for a shield does not allow for a riposte, the roll must be a natural 6.

### Small Sized Combatants
This mainly applies to half sized humanoids (halflings, gnomes, kobolds, etc.) fighting medium sized humanoids (humans, dwarves, elves, etc). 

If you are of this "small" size fighting a medium sized opponent:

- Any constitution damage you deal is halved. This *does not* apply to flesh damage to HP. 
- You receive advantage during grappling if your posture is to disengage.

For example, a halfling equipped with a two-handed long sword should be able to land a lethal blow on a human; however, due to their relative strength, they are unlikely to "wear down" the physical endurance of someone twice their size. Additionally, being small often tends to increase nimbleness and agility, therefore the "small" sized combatant is better suited to escape a grapple.

These advantages do not scale beyond small versus medium opponents.

## Ranged Combat
Ranged combat is a simplified process of the melee combat steps, it does not exhaust your CON unless you are forced into melee.

Those with specalization in bows may perform two attacks instead of one, execept in scenario 4 when forced into melee.

There are four ranged combat scenarios:
1. Firing at a suspecting target not in melee
  - Success on 3 to 6
2. Firing into a target in melee
  - Success on 4 to 6
3. Firing at unsuspecting targets not in combat
  - Success on 3 to 6, with special damage bonuses
4. Firing at a target before being forced into melee
  - Bow or crossbow must be drawn or armed already
  - Success on 4 to 6, with special close range damage bonuses
  - No additional ranged attacks

### 1. Standard Ranged Combat
In this scenario you are firing at a target that is aware they are in combat, but they are not currently engaged in melee.

Roll a standrd 1d6 to attack, on a success of 3 to 6, roll for damage using the standard damage chart.

Apply bonuses based on you roll and wether the opponent is upright or downed.

### 2. Firing into Melee
It is not easy to fire on a target that is engaged in melee. Attack rolls suffer a -1 modifier. This means you cannot do better than a 5.

Roll a standard 1d6 with a -1 modifier, on a roll of 4 to 6, 

### 3. Unsuspecting Targets
Bows in small combat are best utilized against unsuspecting targets, therefore the damage possibilities lend themselves toward the attacker.

These bonuses are only gained if the target is *not* currently engaged in combat.

A ranged attacker makes a 1d6 check to hit their target, akin to a stand skill check.  

| Roll | Ranged Damage v. Unaware Targets | 
|------|----------------------------------|
|   1  |  Miss, target is aware of attack |
|   2  |  Miss, target remains unaware    | 
|   3  |  +1 Con Damage                   |
|   4  |  +2 Con Damage                   |
|   5  |  +1 HP, +2 Con Damage            |
|   6  |  +2 HP, +2 Con Damage            |

Only on a roll of 2 does the target remain unaware of combat; otherwise future attack rolls fall under the other ranged combat scenarios.

On a roll of 1, with a long or shortbow, and with weapon specialization, you may make 1 additional attack for this scenario (3) unsuspecting targets. 

### 4. Forced into Melee
When an opponent charges or attacks a player performing ranged combat, that player may make a single ranged attack.

In this scenario, players must already have their bow drawn or a crossbow armed and aiming. 

Immediatly roll a 1d6, with a success on 4 to 6. On a success roll your damage die and 1d4, determine the total damage per the standard damage chart.

Apply additional damage based on the below chart.

| Roll |   Close Ranged Damage   | 
|------|-------------------------|
|   1  |  Miss                   |
|   2  |  Miss                   | 
|   3  |  Miss                   |
|   4  |  +1 Con Damage          |
|   5  |  +1 HP, +1 Con Damage   |
|   6  |  +2 HP, +1 Con Damage   |

- If the opponent is still alive, the player is forced into melee combat with their ranged weapon as an improvised melee weapon that only deals 1d4 damage.
- If the opponent is upright, they peform a 1d6 melee attack roll and deals damage on a success.
- Players may choose to drop their ranged weapon and unsheath a melee weapon at a cost of 2 CON damage during the ensuing melee.

## Combat against Monsters and Beasts
Tactics used against against monsters and beasts are not the same as those used against a humanoid. 

The concept of an opposed check starts to fall apart when your opponent can spew acid from its mouth or swipe at you with its tail. Attacks like tripping, wrestling, and the like may apply to another humanoid, but they make far less sense against beholder or a rhinocerous. 

Therefore, to keep combat simple, when fighting a target that is not your standard humanoid, such as a  werebear, beholder, or a dragon, damage is done directly to HP and we ignore the Con aspect of combat. Essentially, you are trying to stay alive while trying to wound the beast, ideally landing a killing blow; you are not trying to overwhelm it.

### How do I know I am fighting a monster?
The basic rule of thumb is grappling, can you engage in a grappling struggle with a target and not suffer greatly? For example, would you grapple with 800lb 10 foot tall polar bear? Probably not. Would you engage in a grapple with a 7 foot 300 lb Orc? Maybe.
