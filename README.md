## Serve the game
DMs and players both have have a duty to serve the game, to make the overall experience of this game enjoyable. What enjoyable is, exactly, is not easy to define; however, there are a few items to consider:
- Set expectations; what is the world like, what are the people like?
  - Some worlds are dangerous, some people are distrustful, some places are scary; a DM has a duty to their players to give them sign posts about these details.
- Accept failures; trails, tribulations, can help gameplay as long as they give players opportunities to continue to develop their characters.
  - Consider the [Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey)

## Dice and Checks

The bulk of this system will use D6s for checks and spells; damage will be done with other dice depending on weapons used.
| Roll | Result        | Example opening a locked door                                        |
|------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Major Failure | your lock pick breaks, as does the lock                              |
| 2    | Minor Failure | your lock pick is damaged somewhat                                   |
| 3    | Mixed Results | the lock is damaged but the door will open                           |
| 4    | Mixed Results | the door is unlocked, but cannot be opened quietly                   |
| 5    | Minor Success | the door is unlocked and opens quietly & with ease                   |
| 6    | Major Success | the door is unlocked and you are now more adept at this kind of lock |

A 3 should skew to slightly less good results and 4 should skew to slightly better results, at the DM's discretion.

### Advantage
If your character is skilled in the specific task at hand, you will roll with advantage. Advantage means roll 2d6 and pick the better of the two.

### Relevant Ability Scores & Failure Checks
If you have a relevant ability score of a 5 or 6, a roll of 1 is not necessarily a major failure. You will need to roll again to "confrim the failure" which occurs on a 1 or 2.
 - 1's become minor failures, with a check for major failure. 
   - Roll a "failure confirmation," 1d6 where a 1 or 2 results in a major failure.
 - 2's becomes mixed results, but not entirely in your favor

Examples of relevant abilities for tasks are:
- Dexterity for a climb check
- Strength for a lift check
- Intelligence for a research check

The relevance of an ability is determined by the DM, who should give this information to the player prior to a roll. For instance, if the player is strong and wants to lift 200 Lbs. then they have a relevant ability score; however, if this same player tries to lift 1000 Lbs. then they do not have a relevant ability bonus.

### Defining Success
Before any rolls for checks are made, a DM must give the players an idea what a "success" would generally look like. This could be cracking a safe with ease, or sneaking past a sleeping guard dog unnoticed.

However, some tasks some tasks would simply be outside the ability of a player, and as such a "success" may just be the best case scenario given their abilities. 

As an example, if a player has a high strength and wants to "kick down an iron door," but would not be physically capable due to the iron reinforcements, the DM should inform the player that "at best the player will damage the door, but they could not alone break it down."

We do not necessarily need to give players negative modifiers to prevent them from performing a ridiculous task (solving a quantum equation in minutes), but *we do need* to give them an idea of what they are capable of in the *best possible case*.

As a last note, while a DM should give the idea of possible successes, this should be around a 5 in terms of the die roll as a 6 might give unique or interesting bonuses that themselves should be a surpise.

## Abilities
Like traditional D&D, players should roll their ability scores. It is recommended to “roll down the line” where each rolls is not arranged according to preference. 

For each of the 4 abilities, *roll 2d6* and keep the best number.
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Will
- Intelligence

### Constitution 
Constituion is total sum of Strength, Dexterity, Will, and your current level. Used in combat, it represents your total ability to persevere and survive. The majority of damage in combat is against your constitution, not your flesh and blood. This means that you risk being exhausted and overwhelmed when you take constitution damage.

If your constitution reaches 0, you do not die. However, you collapse and are not reliably able to defend yourself against attacks.

### Intelligence
This represents your ability to learn and both informal and formal education. Half this number and round up, this represents additional skills you receive advantage on. You may also choose to use one of these points on additional languages, instead of skills.

### Charisma
There are no points assigned to charisma. As a role playing game, dialogue is considered a core feature; as such, reducing social interactions to points or rolls limits experience of play in regards to this "core" feature. 

Not all players prefer to role play as their character, but in dialogue based interactions players should come up with details on how or what they do while interacting with NPCs. Simple saying "I want to convince the king to hire us" provides less flavor for everyone else at the table than saying "My character, points out his noble lineage of the House of Swarsington, provides examples of loyalty to the throne (including a list of battles), in order to sway the king to hire us."

This system assumes that a player's character should be however charismatic they want them to be. That does not mean they can charm their way into anything, but any attempt to do so better serves gameplay with thoughtful and engaging dialogue. 

What is a successful charismatic action then? This ultimately should be up to the DM, who should have some concept of what a given NPC might find convincing or not. If a check is needed, simply roll "behind the scenes" based on a standard check. If a player has relevant skills, diplomacy, lying, or is knowledgeable on the topic at hand, consider giving them advantage.  

#### Earned Charisma
Optionally, a DM could keep track of:
- well done charismatic moments
- Moments where a player character would have learned a lesson about social interactions in the game world. 

In this way, if a tally is kept, a DM could hand out a total of number of Charisma points earned in a session. These points could be converted into a free advantage roll when the players receive a certain number depending on the campaign setting. 3 points for an advantage roll gives players incentive to attempt interactions with NPCs

### Hit points
All players have 6 hit points, this does not increase with leveling. Often the rules refer to damage to flesh, this is damage to your hit points--as opposed to damage to your constitution. 

## Background or Heritage 
The Dungeon Master has the last say in allowed heritage or backgrounds (races as is referred to older D&D editions). It is advisable to have limits on player physical size and capacity for flight and speed. In the unlikely event of a game breaking mechanic a DM reservers the right to reduce the power of a unique ability created by a player. Within the limits defined by their DM, players may freely choose any fantasy heritage that they deem that best suits their intended identity.  Some backgrounds could be unbalanced*, the following table is just a suggestion.
| Classic  | Expanded   | Modern*     |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Human    | Half Orc   | Half Giant  |
| Elf      | Half Elf   | Dragonborn  |
| Dwarf    | Gnome      | Tiefling    |
| Halfling |            | Fairy       |

### Pick Two Traits
Traits in this rule set are considered a _broad characteristic_, unlike skills which would apply to specific tasks.
For whatever background a player picks, they should decide 2 traits that describe them (and their people generally) that would effect gameplay.
Examples:
- Dwarf : strong, resistant to poison, stout
- Elf : wise, quick, magic-adept
- Human : quick learned, open minded, strong, quick
- Halfling : sly, quick, stealthy, hungry

Player example: "My character is a tall burly human from the desert region, my people are known for being (1) well educated and (2) stealthy"

Whenever a player has to perform a check that their background would be relevant for, they are able to roll advantage, meaning roll two dice and pick the one they want.

## Skills
Skills are specific abilities that a given player would have, they are more focused than traits and represent your personal experience and training. Except for DM discretion, there are generally no limits to what a skill could be. 

A DM has the right to reject a skill for being too broad. An example of a badly chosen skill would be a character who is good at "building;" structures are build out of a variety of material and techniques, a more appropriate choice would be carpentry or masonry.

All characters have a number of skills based on their intelligence, (Int / 2, rounded up); additionally some classes provide more skills, as does leveling in a class.

Besides during combat, most things *should not* require a skill check. Climbing up an old stonewall, negotiating prices in a market, dressing a wound, are not the sort of things that you would need to have a skill check in. Rather, if a check for a common / general task is *needed* a DM should defer to an ability check.

Skill checks are required when specialized experience or knowledge is required; specifically if failure of the task would lead to terrible consequences. Such as pick pocketing the kings purse, or forging a nobles signature, organizing the constuction of fortified defenses.

Even then, with specialized skills being required, group efforts to resolve a problem with coherent dialog between players should generally trump a skill check. As long as the plan is detailed, concievable, and somewhat reasonable, players should be able to execute complex tasks without pedantic skill checks.

### Sample Combat Skills
These skills are mentioned because they are specifically referenced in the combat rules and would be appropriate for any player interested in combat.
- Grappling
- Wrestling throws
- Disarming
- Improvised weaponry
- Defensive melee combat
- Firing into Melee

### Sample Non-Combat Skills
| samples| samples| samples|
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Carpentry   | Sailing          | Library Research       |
| Bartering   | Lock Picking     | Specialized Knowledge  |
| Fletching   | Forgery          | Diplomacy              |

| Tanning     | Construction     |                        |

## Classes
There are 4 classes based on classic D&D archtypes. While players may pick anything as a subclass as the focal identity of their character, they should try to stay within one of the classes. Classes guide leveling and character advancement.
- Warriors : Someone with advanced combat training
- Rogues : Someone with keen skills or intuition: slyness, discreteness, cleverness, back stabbing
- Magic-Users : Someone with spellcasting abilities, gained from study, natural adeptness to magic, or supernatural influence
- Priests : Someone with spellcasting-like abilities that are inspired by a holy deity or supernatural presence (personified or not)

Players should pick a subclass or identity that falls under one of these types. This is completely open ended, players are free to come up with any kind of identity. Here are some examples:
- Warrior : Streetfighter, Kung Fu Master, Gladiator, Paladin, Ranger, Knight, Swordsman, Samurai, Crossbowmen
- Rogues : Thief, Bard, Assassin, Scout, Swashbuckler, Detective
- Magic-Users : Mage, Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Witch, Necromancer, Illusionist, Sage,
- Priest : Druid, Cleric, Monk, Preacher, Cultist

Players should develop a clear idea of what background, training, or expierence they have.

### Warriors
Warriors start with 1 weapon specialization, players may freely pick any weapon that suits their intended character identity.
This gives them the following abilities with their chosen weapon:
 - For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, ignore 1 major failure
 - For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, advantage roll for damage
 - For combat with their chosen weapon, for any attack, either +1 to their damage rolls or +1 attack rolls

For every even level as a warrior (2,4,6,etc.) they may gain either:
- 1 additional weapon specialization, they gain the above 3 abilities for this weapon.
- 1 combat weapon feat. This is like a skill but it pertains to just 1 weapon type. Players should be creative here and work with their DM. Examples include:
  - Swift attack, gain +1 attacks with weapon against a specific target (recommended limit of +2)
  - Heavy attack, deal +1 constitution damage
  - Lethal attack, deal +1 body damage on 6's
  - Cleaving attack, upon successful downing of opponent gain 1 attack on any adjacent enemy,

### Rogues
Rogues starts with 3 skill specializations, they may pick any **specific** skill or task to have an advangtage doing. This is more narrow than the background traits. Generally this should follow a rogue-ish motif, but with a good character concept a player should not feel limited. Examples include:
- Sneaking: players are talented at moving around in a hidden fashion and hiding in shadows
- Lock picking: players are exceptional at opening a variety of locks
- Sleight of hand: players are talented at being physically misleading and trickery
- Lying / verbal deception: players are exceptional at spinning falsehoods to unknowing victims
- Seduction: players exude charisma and physical attraction, NPCs have a disadvantage when trying to resist player suggestions
- Back stabbing: players have an advantage to successful stab an unwitting victim (flesh damage not constition, see Combat)

Weapon Proficiency: may choose 1 weapon to be skilled in combat with. For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, may either:
- ignore 1 major failure
- advantage roll for damage

For every even level as a rogue (2,4,6,etc.) they may gain one of:
- one additional skill, rogueish or relevant to their character's experience
- one additional advantage die for a given skill, limit of +2. For instance, Backstabing +2 means roll 3 die pick the best roll.
- one additional weapon proficiency


### Magic-Users
Mages know 1 spell at level 1 and can cast up to 1 spell a day. Additionally, Mages gain 1 skill based on their subclass. This could be knowldged based, experience based, training based, etc. Some example include:
- Knowledge of local history
- speak an ancient language fluently
- skilled in diplomatic policies
- skilled in debate
- Strategic warfare
- Mercantile economics

#### Spell Progression
| Level | Spells per day |
|-------|----------------|
|   1   |  1  -  -  -  -  -   |
|   2   |  2  -  -  -  -  -   |
|   3   |  2 1  -  -  -  -   |

|   8   |  3 3 2 2  -  -   |
|   9   |  3 3 2 2 1  -   |

|   12  |  4 4 3 3 3 2   |
|   13  |  4 4 4 3 3 3   |
|   14  |  4 4 4 4 3 3   |

### Priests
Priests are distinguished from magic-users becuase they *believe* (with or without good justification) that their magical abilities are both:
- attuned to a moral or natural order of the universe
- only possible due to a supernatural influence

The ability of a priest to case a healing spell, for example, is evidence to them that their moral / religious/ supernatural based beliefs are objectively correct. 

There are two types of priests, "holy warriors" who fight for their gods / beliefs and "holy ritualists" who channel divine powers and perform rituals.

#### Holy Warriors
- Do not gain spell abilities at level 1, they gain them at level 3 after proving their faith
- Never gain the ability to perform rituals
- Can turn the undead
- Have 1 weapon specialization
- Skilled in tending the wounded

#### Holy Ritualists
- Start with 1 spell known, 1 cast per day
- Can perform 1 ritual versions of a spell over the course of 1 hour, without "casting" them.
- Can turn the undead
- Skilled in tending the wounded

If a player wants their character to have doubts about a religion yet be able to practice priest-like qualities, they can hold this class. It is recommended they either try to "keep up appearances" or are actively deal with a spiritual dilemma in-game and in-character. Otherwise a player should make a magic-user and just say "they were once a priest." 

#### Spell Progression
| Level | Spells per day |
|-------|----------------|
|   1\*   | 1 - - - -    |
|   2   |   1 - - - -    |
|   3   |   2 - - - -    |
|   4   |   2 1 - - -    |
|   5   |   2 2 - - -    |
|   6   |   2 2 1 1 -    |

|   13  |   5 5 5 4 4    |
|   14  |   6 5 5 5 4    |

*Only a holy ritualist gains a spell at first level, not a holy warrior.

## Equipment

### Weapons

| Size | Damage | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 1d4 | club, dagger, dart, |
| Medium | 1d6 | short sword, rapier, quarter staff, handaxe, mace, 1h spear |
| Long, heavy | 1d8 | 1h longsword, 1h battleaxe, greatclub, flail |
| Two Handed | 2d6 | 2h longsword, 2h battleaxe, 2h spear |
| Great | 1d12 | greatsword, great axe, heavy polearms |

#### Great Weapons 
These are heavy, oversized, two handed weapons. Therefore, without proper training and strength, they are slower to use.
To use one without penalty, you must:
- Have a specialization in with a specific great weapon
- have a 6 in strength

If you do not meet both of these requirements, then suffer a -1 on Dex related combat result checks.
Lastly, you may *not use dex* for cut related combat checks.

### Armor

Armor reduces the damage of successful attacks that deal damage to flesh, and a smaller reduction to damage against constitution. However, in combat, any type damage cannot reduced to 0; meaning, at least 1 point of damage must be dealt to either flesh or constitution.

| Size   | Defense | Examples                    |
|--------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Light  | -1 / 0  | leather, studded leather    |
| Medium | -3 / -1 | chainmail, beastplate, hide |
| Heavy  | -5 / -2 | platemail, scalemail        |

#### Shields
Whether a buckler, heater, or tower shield, all shields provide a +1 bonus to parry.

## Melee Combat Against Humanoids
All attacks are opposed checks, but the action performed is chosen by a dice roll. One versus one combat is simple enough, both sides roll 1d6. However, if the scenario is one versus two or more, the one may opt for a defensive stance.

The combat loop is as follows:
- Prepare, set your one's and engagement posture
- roll opposing dice
- react to results, decide to use dex or str & roll accordingly
- winner deals damage, 

### Ones Are...
Before a attack roll is performed players must declare a "Ones are," meaning players pick what the result of a 1 die roll should be. This is ideally based on the player's weapon as they may prefer to priorize certain actions, such as a thrust with a spear or a cut with an axe. They may pick any of the options except ripostes.

### Engagement
In the thick of combat, the blows may turn to a grapple. Prior to attack players may choose their default posture, to engage in grapple or to disengage. If their default posture is to disengage, they gain a +1 to win a grapple challenge but do not enter the grapple.

### Combat Attack Roll
representing the following actions
- \[ 2 \] Cuts: swinging & slicing actions
    - Additional damage (+2) for sharp edged **great** weapons, only on successes
- \[ 3 \] Thrusts: piercing actions
    - Additional damage (+2) giving to those designed for it, e.g. spears & swords, only on successes
- \[ 4 \] Parries: blocking the blow of a weapon with your weapon
    - a major successful parry allows for a riposte*
- \[ 5 \] Dodges: evading an attack with quick movement
- \[ 6 \] Grapples: clinging to your opponent to attempt a throw, with or without your weapon
- *Ripostes: a follow up attack after a parry, half damage
    - with weapon specialization, does normal damage

### Combat Attack Results
The priorty table to determine result check:

|Priority | Opposing Rolls      | Check        |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
|   1     | Grapple v. Grapple  | Str          |
|   2     | Grapple v. any      | Dex then Str |
|   3     | Dodge v. Any        | Dex          |
|   4     | Cut v. Any          | Dex or Str   |
|   5     | Thrust v. Thrusts   | Dex          |
|   6     | Parry v. Thrusts    | Dex          |
|   7     | Others              | No Result    | 

A table view of the same information:
|       |Cut  |Thrust|Parry|Dodge|Grapple|
|-------|-----|------|-----|-----|-------|
|Cut    | DvS | DvS  | DvS | Dex | D&S   |
|Thrust | DvS | Dex  | Dex | Dex | D&S   |
|Parry  | DvS | Dex  | nil | nil | D&S   |
|Dodge  | Dex | Dex  | nil | nil | D&S   |
|Grapple| D&S | D&S  | D&S | D&S | Str   |

### Opposed Checks & Damage
Once you've determined which check will occur, whether strength or dex (or none at all), each side rolls 1d6 + the attribute.

The higher value wins the check and deals damage. 

The rolled value determines if the damage effects the oppents flesh or constitution.

To succeed in a grapple check, you must first win a dex check to wrestle your opponent, and then a strength check to enter the grapple phase. If both sides attempt a grapple, you only need the strength check.

#### Riposte
If a player rolled a parry versus a cut or thrust, and they win the opposed check with a roll of 6, they may riposte!

A riposte is follow up successful attack that allows for a standard damage roll, but if the player does not have specailization with the weapon, it is half damage.

### Damage
Damage is split between flesh / body and constitution. Most attacks do not deal damage directly to the opponent's flesh but wears them down. A successful grapple does not follow this chart, see the next section.
| Roll | Melee Damage      | Damage while downed | 
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
|   1  | Constitution      | Constitution        | 
|   2  | Constitution      | 1 flesh, Con - 1    | 
|   3  | Constitution      | 1 flesh, Con - 1    | 
|   4  | Constitution      | 2 flesh, Con - 2    | 
|   5  | 1 flesh & Con - 1 | 3 flesh, Con - 3    | 
|   6  | 2 flesh & Con - 2 | 4 flesh, Con - 4    | 

When you see "Con - 1" it means of the total damage dealt, 1 point harms the flesh and the remainder harms constitution.

### Grappling and Wrestling
If only one combatant attempts a grapple, the check is dexterity; this represents the lunge or springing action an attacker would make to quickly close distance before a strike is made against them. Also, is represents the opponent swinging their weapon or moving away from the grappler. 

However, if both sides are performing a grapple, then we move straight to the opposed strength check to see who dominates.

Once opponents are in a grapple and one side has won the strength check, there are few options for following actions. Each of which is a standard 1d6 skill check to succeed. These maneurves are the sort of thing a warrior would want to have "skills" in, giving them an "advantage roll."
- Disarm the opponent: Attempt to remove the opponent's weapon, this is ideal for forcing a yield. 
- Throw the opponent to the ground: Drastically reduce an opponents defensive capabilities by forcing them into a prone position, this is ideal for a swift kill.

### Ranged Combat
Ranged combat is a simplified process of the melee combat steps. You simple need to roll a standard 1d6 skill check to attack the target.

Only upon a success (3-6), roll for damage using the above damage chart.

#### Unsuspecting Targets
Bows in small combat are best utilized against unsuspecting targets, therefore the damage possibiliies lend themselves toward the attacker.

The below chart indicates the results of the attack roll based on the current status of the target.

| Roll | Ranged Damage v. Unmoving & Unaware targets   | Ranged Damage v. Moving & Unaware Targets | 
|------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|   1  | Miss, target is now aware of attack           | Miss, target is now aware of the attack   |
|   2  | 1 flesh, Con - 1                              | Miss, target still unaware                | 
|   3  | 2 flesh, Con - 2                              | 1 flesh, Con - 1                          |
|   4  | 3 flesh, Con - 3                              | 2 flesh, Con - 2                          |
|   5  | 4 flesh, Con - 4                              | 3 flesh, Con - 3                          |
|   6  | 5 flesh, Con - 5                              | 4 flesh, Con - 4                          |

#### Firing into Melee
It is not easy to fire on a target that is engaged in melee. Attack rolls suffer a -1 modifier.
If you do not have a specialization for this particular skill "Firing into melee" you must take a -1 modifier to your attack roll. This means you cannot do better than a 5, and a 1 or 2 would result in a major failure.

### Defensive Fighting
In the case where a player or NPC is prone or surrounded by more than 1 opponent, they may wish to engage in defensive fighting to keep the attackers at bay. This is distinct from melee combat because they are *not* rolling on the combat attack roll chart. The goals for fighting defensively are:
- Keep enemies at bay
- Parry incoming attacks
- Avoid being encircled
- Regain footing after being knock down

### Small Sized Combatants
This mainly applies to half sized humanoids (halflings, gnomes, kobolds, etc.) fighting medium sized humanoids (humans, dwarves, elves, etc). 

If you are of this "small" size fighting a medium sized opponent:
- Any constitution damage you deal is halved. This *does not* apply to flesh damage to HP. 
- You receive advantage during grappling if your posture is to disengage.

For example, a halfling equipped with a two-handed long sword should be able to land a lethal blow on a human; however, due to their relative strength, they are unlikely to "wear down" the physical endurance of someone twice their size. Additionally, being small often tends to increase nimbleness and agility, therefore the "small" sized combatant is better suited to escape a grapple.

These advantages do not scale beyond small versus medium opponents.

## Combat against Monsters and Beasts
Tactics used against against monsters and beasts are not the same as those used against a humanoid. 

The concept of an opposed check starts to fall apart when your opponent can spew acid from its mouth or swipe at you with its tail. Attacks like tripping, wrestling, and the like may apply to another humanoid, but they make far less sense against beholder or a rhinocerous. 

Therefore, to keep combat simple, when fighting a target that is not your standard humanoid, such as a  werebear, beholder, or a dragon, damage is done directly to HP and we ignore the Con aspect of combat. Essentially, you are trying to stay alive while trying to wound the beast, ideally landing a killing blow; you are not trying to overwhelm it.

### How do I know I am fighting a monster?
The basic rule of thumb is grappling, can you engage in a grappling struggle with a target and not suffer greatly? For example, would you grapple with 800lb 10 foot tall polar bear? Probably not. Would you engage in a grapple with a 7 foot 300 lb Orc? Maybe. 

### Combat Loop, Modified for Monsters and Beasts
The combat loop against a monster is as follows:
- Prepare, set your one's and engagement posture
  - Posture is different here, just defensive or offensive
- roll combat attack dice
- react to results
- winner deals damage
