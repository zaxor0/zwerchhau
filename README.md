## Dice and Checks

The bulk of this system will use D6s for checks and spells, damage will be done with other dice depending on weapons used.
| Die Roll          | Example opening a locked door                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [1] Major Failure | your lock pick breaks, as does the lock                              |
| [2] Minor Failure | your lock pick is damaged somewhat                                   |
| [3] Mixed Results | the lock is damaged but the door will open                           |
| [4] Mixed Results | the door is unlocked, but cannot be opened quietly                   |
| [5] Minor Success | the door is unlocked and opens quietly & with ease                   |
| [6] Major Success | the door is unlocked and you are now more adept at this kind of lock |

A 3 should skew to slightly less good results and 4 should skew to slightly better results, at the DM's discretion.

### Advantage
If your character is skilled in the specific task at hand, you will roll with advantage. Advantage means roll 2d6 and pick the better of the two.

### Relevant Ability Scores
If you have a relevant ability score of a 5 or 6, a roll of 1 is not necessarily a major failure.
 - 1's become minor failures, with a check for major failure. Roll 1 more die, an on a 1 or 2 it becomes a major failure.
 - 2's becomes mixed results, but not entirely in your favor

Examples of relevant abilities for tasks are:
- Dexterity for a climb check
- Strength for a lift check
- Intelligence for a research check

## Abilities
Like traditional D&D, players should roll their ability scores. It is recommended to “roll down the line” where each rolls is not arranged according to preference. 

For each of the 4 abilities, *roll 2d6* and keep the best number.
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Will
- Intelligence

### Endurance
Endurace is total sum of Strength, Dexterity, and Will. Used in combat, it represents your total ability to perserve and survive. The majority of damage in combat is against your endurance, not your flesh and blood. 

If your endurance reaches 0, you collapse and are not reliably able to defend yourself against a coup de gras.

### Intelligence
This represents your ability to learn and both informal and formal education. Half this number and round up, this represents additional skills you receive advantage on. You may also choose to use one of these points on additional languages, instead of skills.

## Background or Heritage 
The Dungeon Master has the last say in allowed heritage or backgrounds (races as is referred to older D&D editions). It is advisable to have limits on player physical size and capacity for flight and speed. In the unlikely event of a game breaking mechanic a DM reservers the right to reduce the power of a unique ability created by a player. Within the limits defined by their DM, players may freely choose any fantasy heritage that they deem that best suits their intended identity.  Some backgrounds could be unbalanced*, the following table is just a suggestion.
| Classic  | Expanded   | Modern*     |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Human    | Half Orc   | Half Giant  |
| Elf      | Half Elf   | Dragonborn  |
| Dwarf    | Gnome      | Tiefling    |
| Halfling |            | Fairy       |

### Pick Two Traits
Traits in this rule set are considered a broad characteristic, unlike skills which would apply to specific tasks.
For whatever background a player picks, they should decide 2 traits that describe them (and their people generally) that would effect gameplay.
Examples:
- Dwarf : strong, resistant to poison, stout
- Elf : wise, quick, magic-adept
- Human : quick learned, open minded, strong, quick
- Halfling : sly, quick, stealthy, hungry

Player example: "My character is a tall burly human from the desert region, my people are known for being (1) strong-willed and (2) stealthy"

Whenever a player has to perform a check that their background would be relevant for, they are able to roll advantage, meaning roll two dice and pick the one they want.

If the DM wants humans to be more generic, then they should just gain +2 skills to have advantage on as opposed to the more broad traits.

## Classes
There are 4 classes based on classic D&D archtypes. While players may pick anything as a subclass as the focal identity of their character, they should try to stay within one of the classes. Classes guide leveling and character advancement.
- Warriors : Someone with advanced combat training
- Rogues : Someone with keen skills or intuition: slyness, discreteness, cleverness, back stabbing
- Magic-Users : Someone with spellcasting abilities, gained from study or supernatural influence
- Priests : Someone with powers influence or inspired by a holy deity or supernatural presence (personified or not)

Players should pick a subclass or identity that falls under one of these types. This is completely open ended, players are free to come up with any kind of identity. Here are some examples:
- Warrior : Streetfighter, Kung Fu Master, Gladiator, Paladin, Ranger, Knight, Swordsman, Samurai, Crossbowmen
- Rogues : Thief, Bard, Assassin, Scout, Swashbuckler, Detective
- Magic-Users : Mage, Wizard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Witch, Necromancer, Illusionist, Sage,
- Priest : Druid, Cleric, Monk, Preacher, Cultist

Players should develop a clear idea of what background, training, or expierence they have.

### Warriors
Warriors start with 1 weapon specialization, players may freely pick any weapon that suits their intended character identity.
This gives them the following abilities with their chosen weapon:
 - For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, ignore 1 major failure
 - For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, advantage roll for damage
 - For combat with their chosen weapon, for any attack, either +1 to their damage rolls or +1 attack rolls

For every even level as a warrior (2,4,6,etc.) they may gain either:
- 1 additional weapon specialization, they gain the above 3 abilities for this weapon.
- 1 combat weapon feat. This is like a skill but it pertains to just 1 weapon type. Players should be creative here and work with their DM. Examples include:
  - Swift attack, gain +1 attacks with weapon against a specific target (recommended limit of +2)
  - Heavy attack, deal +1 endurance damage
  - Lethal attack, deal +1 body damage on 6's
  - Cleaving attack, upon successful downing of opponent gain 1 attack on any adjacent enemy,

### Rogues
Rogues starts with 3 skill specializations, they may pick any **specific** skill or task to have an advangtage doing. This is more narrow than the background traits. Generally this should follow a rogue-ish motif, but with a good character concept a player should not feel limited. Examples include:
- Sneaking: players are talented at moving around in a hidden fashion and hiding in shadows
- Lock picking: players are exceptional at opening a variety of locks
- Sleight of hand: players are talented at being physically misleading and trickery
- Lying / verbal deception: players are exceptional at spinning falsehoods to unknowing victims
- Seduction: players exude charisma and physical attraction, NPCs have a disadvantage when trying to resist player suggestions
- Back stabbing: players have an advantage to successful stab an unwitting victim (body damage not endurance, see Combat)

Weapon Proficiency: may choose 1 weapon to be skilled in combat with. For combat with their chosen weapon, once per day, may either:
- ignore 1 major failure
- advantage roll for damage

For every even level as a rogue (2,4,6,etc.) they may gain one of:
- one additional skill, rogueish or relevant to their character's experience
- one additional advantage die for a given skill, limit of +2. For instance, Backstabing +2 means roll 3 die pick the best roll.
- one additional weapon proficiency


### Magic-Users
Mages know 4 spells at level 1 and can cast up to 3 spells a day. Additionally, Mages gain 1 skill based on their subclass. This could be knowldged based, experience based, training based, etc. Some example include:
- Knowledge of local history
- speak an ancient language fluently
- skilled in diplomatic policies
- skilled in debate
- knowledge of large battle strategy

## Equipment

### Weapons

| Size | Damage | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 1d4 | club, dagger, dart, |
| Medium | 1d6 | short sword, rapier, quarter staff, handaxe, mace, 1h spear |
| Long, heavy | 1d8 | 1h longsword, 1h battleaxe, greatclub, flail |
| Two Handed | 2d6 | 2h longsword, 2h battleaxe, 2h spear |
| Great | 1d12 | greatsword, great axe, heavy polearms |

#### Great Weapons 
These are heavy, oversized, two handed weapons. Therefore, without proper training and strength, they are slower to use.
To use one without penalty, you must:
- Have a specialization in with a specific great weapon
- have a 6 in strength

If you do not meet both of these requirements, then suffer a -1 on Dex related combat result checks.
Lastly, you may *not use dex* for cut related combat checks.

### Armor

Armor reduces the damage of successful attacks that deal damage to flesh, and a smaller reduction to damage against endurance. However, in combat, any type damage cannot reduced to 0.

| Size | Defense | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light | -2 / -1 | leather, studded leather |
| Medium | -4 / -2 | chainmail, beastplate, hide |
| Heavy | -6 / -3 | platemail, scalemail |

#### Shields
Whether a buckler, heater, or tower shield, all shields provide a +1 bonus to parry.

## Combat
All attacks are opposed checks, but the action performed is chosen by a dice roll. One versus one combat is simple enough, both sides roll 1d6. However, if the scenario is one versus two or more, the one may opt for a defensive stance.

The combat loop is as follows:
- Prepare, set your one's and engagement posture
- roll opposing dice
- react to results, decide to use dex or str & roll accordingly
- winner deals damage, 

### Ones Are...
Before a attack roll is performed players must declare a "Ones are," meaning players pick what the result of a 1 die roll should be. This is ideally based on the player's weapon as they may prefer to priorize certain actions, such as a thrust with a spear or a cut with an axe. They may pick any of the options except ripostes.

### Engagement
In the thick of combat, the blows may turn to a grapple. Prior to attack players may choose their default posture, to engage in grapple or to disengage. If their default posture is to disengage, they gain a +1 to win a grapple challenge but do not enter the grapple.

### Combat Attack Roll
representing the following actions
- \[ 2 \] Cuts: swinging & slicing actions
    - Additional damage (+2) for sharp edged **great** weapons, only on successes
- \[ 3 \] Thrusts: piercing actions
    - Additional damage (+2) giving to those designed for it, e.g. spears & swords, only on successes
- \[ 4 \] Parries: blocking the blow of a weapon with your weapon
    - a major successful parry allows for a riposte*
- \[ 5 \] Dodges: evading an attack with quick movement
- \[ 6 \] Grapples: clinging to your opponent to attempt a throw, with or without your weapon
- *Ripostes: a follow up attack after a parry, half damage
    - with weapon specialization, does normal damage

### Combat Result Check
The priorty table to determine result check:
```
1. Any Dodge..........Dex
2. Any Cut............Dex or Str
3. Thrust v. Thrusts..Dex
4. Parry v. Thrusts...Dex
5. One Grapple........Dex then Str
6. Grapple v Grapple..Str
7. Others.............No Result / nil 
```
